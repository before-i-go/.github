        "# Product Requirements Document: Drive → Colab → Google Sheets Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This document outlines the requirements for a Google Colab notebook that facilitates the extraction, indexing, and preparation of text data from Google Drive files for analysis and processing in Google Sheets, specifically leveraging the capabilities of Gemini in Sheets. The goal is to provide users with a simple, code-based pipeline to bring unstructured text data into a structured format suitable for AI-driven insights within a familiar spreadsheet environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "* Enable users to easily extract text content from various document types stored in Google Drive (txt, md, pdf, docx, HTML, Google Docs, JSON).\n",
        "* Create a structured table of contents (TOC) with unique file metadata, including filepaths.\n",
        "* Generate a staging table containing extracted text, chunked for larger files, and pre-populated with common AI prompt columns for use with Gemini in Sheets.\n",
        "* Minimize reliance on external services or complex infrastructure, using only Colab, Drive API, and Sheets API.\n",
        "* Provide a robust and scalable solution for processing a significant number of files.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. User Journey\n",
        "\n",
        "The end-to-end user journey through the Colab notebook is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Accessing the Notebook:** The user opens the Google Colab notebook.\n",
        "2.  **Understanding the Pipeline:** The user reads the introductory markdown cells to understand the purpose, design goals, and overall flow of the pipeline.\n",
        "3.  **Environment Setup:** The user runs the environment setup cells, which may include installing necessary libraries (though the current version aims to minimize this for common file types).\n",
        "4.  **Authentication:** The user runs the authentication cells to authorize the notebook to access their Google Drive and Google Sheets. This typically involves a standard Google OAuth flow.\n",
        "5.  **Configuration:** The user configures the pipeline by:\n",
        "    *   Selecting the `SEARCH_MODE` ('ALL\\_DRIVE' or 'FOLDER').\n",
        "    *   Providing a `FOLDER_ID` if `SEARCH_MODE` is set to 'FOLDER'.\n",
        "    *   Sp ecifying which Google Apps to include (`INCLUDE_GOOGLE_APPS`).\n",
        "    *   Defining the file extensions to include (`EXTS`).\n",
        "    *   Setting a `MAX_FILES` limit.\n",
        "    *   (Optional) Configuring `TEXT_CHUNK_SIZE` if chunking is desired for large files.\n",
        "    *   Reviewing the automatically generated `SHEET_NAME`.\n",
        "6.  **Drive Listing:** The user runs the cell to list supported files in the specified Drive scope. The notebook iterates through files, applying filters based on the configuration.\n",
        "7.  **Text Extraction & Indexing:** The user runs the cells that perform text extraction for each supported file.\n",
        "    *   The notebook downloads file content via the Drive API.\n",
        "    *   It uses appropriate extraction logic for each file type (plain text for .txt/.md, basic HTML stripping, Google Docs export, basic docx parsing, simple JSON string extraction, placeholders for PDF).\n",
        "    *   For larger files, the extracted text is split into smaller chunks based on `TEXT_CHUNK_SIZE`.\n",
        "    *   Metadata (file name, type, size, modification time, Drive link) and extracted text (or text chunks) are collected.\n",
        "    *   Basic text analysis (word count, URL count) is performed on the extracted text/chunks.\n",
        "8.  **DataFrame Creation:** The collected data is organized into a pandas DataFrame. Each row in the DataFrame represents either an entire file (if not chunked) or a specific chunk of a larger file.\n",
        "9.  **Publishing to Google Sheets:** The user runs the cells to publish the generated data to a new Google Sheet.\n",
        "    *   The notebook creates a new Google Sheet with a timestamped name.\n",
        "    *   It creates two tabs: 'TOC' and 'STAGING'.\n",
        "    *   The 'TOC' tab is populated with unique file metadata, including filepaths (one row per original file).\n",
        "    *   The 'STAGING' tab is populated with file name, Drive link, extracted text/chunks (`source_text`), and several columns pre-populated with AI prompt columns (`PROMPT_SUMMARY`, `PROMPT_URLS`, etc.).\n",
        "    *   The notebook provides the URL of the newly created Google Sheet.\n",
        "10. **Analysis in Google Sheets:** The user opens the generated Google Sheet. They navigate to the 'STAGING' tab.\n",
        "11. **Leveraging Gemini in Sheets:** The user selects a cell in one of the `PROMPT_*` columns. Using the `=GEMINI.SOMETHING(...)` functions available in Google Sheets (if they have access to Gemini in Sheets), they reference the `source_text` column in the same row to generate summaries, extract information, or perform other AI tasks directly within the spreadsheet, writing results into a new column.\n",
        "12. **Further Analysis:** The user can then perform further analysis, filtering, sorting, or visualization within Google Sheets using the generated AI outputs alongside the original file metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Features\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Drive Integration:** Connects to Google Drive via API.\n",
        "*   **Flexible Scope:** Supports searching the entire Drive or a specific folder.\n",
        "*   **File Type Support:** Extracts text from .txt, .md, .markdown, .docx, .html, .htm, .json, Google Docs, with placeholders for .pdf.\n",
        "*   **Text Extraction:** Implements basic text extraction logic for supported file types.\n",
        "*   **HTML Cleaning:** Includes a minimal HTML tag stripper.\n",
        "*   **Large File Handling:** Chunks large text files into smaller segments.\n",
        "*   **Metadata Capture:** Collects file ID, name, MIME type, size, modification time, and web view link.\n",
        "*   **Basic Text Analysis:** Calculates word count and URL count.\n",
        "*   **Google Sheets Integration:** Creates a new Google Sheet and populates multiple tabs.\n",
        "*   **TOC Generation:** Creates a Table of Contents sheet with unique file metadata, including filepaths (one row per original file).\n",
        "*   **Staging Data:** Creates a staging sheet with extracted text/chunks and pre-defined AI prompt columns.\n",
        "*   **Gemini in Sheets Compatibility:** Structures the staging data to be directly usable with Gemini in Sheets functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Future Enhancements\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Improved PDF and DOCX text extraction using dedicated libraries (e.g., pypdf, python-docx).\n",
        "*   Handling of additional file types (e.g., presentations, spreadsheets - though text extraction might be less meaningful).\n",
        "*   More sophisticated HTML parsing and cleaning.\n",
        "*   Configurable chunking strategies (e.g., based on semantic boundaries).\n",
        "*   Option to include embeddings of text chunks.\n",
        "*   Error handling and reporting for failed file processing.\n",
        "*   More detailed progress indicators during Drive crawling and extraction.\n",
        "*   Option to append to an existing Google Sheet instead of creating a new one.\n",
        "*   Configuration options for the specific AI prompt columns generated."

URLs: https://37signals.com/podcast/q-and-hey-1/ and https://37signals.com/podcast/q-and-hey-2/ Interpreting engagement data requires understanding the nuances of each platform, as direct comparisons are often misleading. Here is a guide to the publicly available metrics and their limitations:\\n\\n**Video Platforms (YouTube, Vimeo):**\\n*   **YouTube:** Publicly displays Views, Likes, and Comments. \\n    *   **Views:** A 'view' is counted when a user intentionally initiates watching a video. YouTube's algorithms filter out low-quality playbacks. For paid ads, a view is counted after 30 seconds of watch time or an interaction. The public view count is often considered a 'vanity metric' because YouTube's internal ranking algorithm prioritizes private metrics like 'watch time' and 'average view duration'.\\n    *   **Likes:** A straightforward metric reflecting user appreciation. The public 'dislike' count was removed in December 2021.\\n*   **Vimeo:** Publicly shows Likes and Comments, but detailed analytics like views are private to the creator.\\n\\n**Blogging Platforms (Medium, HEY World):**\\n*   **Medium:** Publicly displays 'Claps' and 'Responses' (comments). \\n    *   **Claps:** This metric is not a unique count of users. A single user can 'clap' up to 50 times for one article. Therefore, the total clap count can be inflated and is not comparable to a 'like' on other platforms. Key metrics like total Views and Reads are private to the author.\\n*   **HEY World / Signal v. Noise:** These platforms do not have built-in public engagement metrics like likes, claps, or visible comment counts. Engagement can only be inferred externally through social media shares or discussions.\\n\\n**Podcast Platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify):**\\n*   **Apple Podcasts:** Publicly shows an average star Rating and the total number of Ratings/Reviews. These are country-specific and do not influence charts. Crucial metrics like Play counts, Download counts, and Follower counts are private.\\n*   **Spotify:** As of May 2025, Spotify displays 'Plays' for episodes, but this is not a precise number. It is shown as milestone markers (e.g., '50K plays') only after an episode surpasses a certain threshold. The actual play count is private. The internal 'Stream' metric (60 seconds of listening) used for monetization is also private.\\n\\n**Challenges of Cross-Platform Comparison:**\\n*   **Incomparable Units:** A YouTube 'view' is defined differently from a Spotify 'play' or a Medium 'read' (which is private). A YouTube 'like' is a single action, while a Medium 'clap' can be up to 50 actions from one person. They cannot be compared numerically.\\n*   **Public vs. Private Data:** Most platforms reserve the most valuable engagement data (watch time, average consumption, unique listeners/readers) for creators' private dashboards. The public metrics are often simplified for general audiences and lack the depth needed for true performance analysis.\\n*   **Conclusion:** When viewing the 'engagement' data, it is essential to consider it on a platform-by-platform basis. For example, you can compare the relative views of two YouTube videos but should not compare YouTube views to Medium claps. The most consistently comparable metric, albeit with its own variations, is the comment count. This dataset was compiled using several important data collection and normalization strategies to ensure its accuracy and completeness.\\n\\n**1. Deduplication and Canonicalization:**\\nDHH and Jason Fried's content often appears on multiple platforms simultaneously (e.g., an article posted on their personal blog, the company blog, and Medium). To avoid redundancy and present a single source of truth, a process of canonicalization was implemented.\\n\\n*   **Canonical Priority:** A hierarchy was established to determine the primary or 'canonical' URL for each piece of content. The priority is as follows:\\n    1.  **Author's/Company's Owned Sites:** The highest priority is given to platforms they directly own and operate, such as `signalvnoise.com` and `dhh.dk`, as these are typically the original sources.\\n    2.  **HEY World Blogs:** Their current primary blogs (`world.hey.com/dhh` and `world.hey.com/jason`) are the next priority, as these pages declare themselves as the canonical source.\\n    3.  **Syndication Platforms (Medium):** Platforms like Medium are treated as the lowest priority, as they were often used for syndication. Content on Medium frequently contains a `rel=\\\"canonical\\\"` HTML tag pointing back to the original source.\\n\\n*   **Detection Methods:** Duplicates were identified using a multi-layered approach:\\n    *   **Explicit Canonical Tags:** Checking for `rel=\\\"canonical\\\"` tags in the HTML.\\n    *   **Content Matching:** Comparing titles, authors, and publication dates across platforms.\\n    *   **Text Similarity:** Using algorithms like Cosine Similarity on the normalized text content to find near-duplicates that may have minor edits.\\n\\n*   **Preserving Engagement:** While duplicates are merged under a single canonical URL, any platform-specific engagement metrics (e.g., claps and responses from a Medium version) are preserved and linked to the canonical record to provide a full picture of the content's reach.\\n\\n**2. Use of Archival Sources (The Wayback Machine):**\\nTo recover older or defunct content, the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine was used extensively. \\n\\n*   **Content Recovery:** The archives for `signalvnoise.com` and DHH's personal blog `dhh.dk` were probed to find posts from the early 2000s that are no longer on the live web.\\n*   **Completeness Verification:** Archived versions of index pages (e.g., `signalvnoise.com/archives`) and RSS/Atom feeds were used to create a master list of 'expected' content. This master list was then used to verify how much of their historical work has been successfully archived and to identify gaps.\\n*   **Data Provenance:** Any content recovered from an archive is clearly marked as such in the dataset, including the specific snapshot date and URL from the Wayback Machine, ensuring data integrity and transparency. The dataset is structured with the following fields for each record. This schema is designed to be comprehensive, providing not only the user-requested information but also additional metadata for deeper analysis.\\n\\n*   **`topic_primary`** (String): The main topic of the content, assigned from a defined taxonomy (e.g., 'Software Engineering/Technology', 'Product Management/Development', 'Calm Company').\\n*   **`topic_secondary`** (String): A secondary topic, if applicable.\\n*   **`name`** (String): The official title or headline of the content item (e.g., the blog post title, video title, or podcast episode name).\\n*   **`content_text`** (String): The full text of the content, such as the body of an article or the transcript of a video or podcast.\\n*   **`summary_1liner`** (String): A concise, 15-30 word summary of the content's core message, written in plain language for a learner.\\n*   **`author`** (String): The name of the content creator (e.g., 'David Heinemeier Hansson', 'Jason Fried').\\n*   **`date_published`** (String): The original publication date and time of the content, in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-08-14T12:00:00Z`).\\n*   **`date_updated`** (String): The date and time the content was last modified, in ISO 8601 format.\\n*   **`url`** (String): The direct URL where the content was retrieved.\\n*   **`canonical_url`** (String): The single, authoritative URL for the content, especially important for items cross-posted on multiple platforms.\\n*   **`source_platform`** (String): The platform where the content is hosted (e.g., 'HEY World', 'YouTube', 'Signal v. Noise', 'Medium', 'Rework Podcast').\\n*   **`type_of_content`** (String): The format of the content (e.g., 'Blog Post', 'Video', 'Podcast Episode', 'Book Summary', 'Gist').\\n*   **`tags`** (Array of Strings): A list of any keywords or tags directly associated with the content on its source platform.\\n*   **`engagement_metrics`** (JSON Object): A structured object containing publicly available engagement data. The structure varies by platform, for example:\\n    *   For YouTube: `{ \\\"viewCount\\\": 140123, \\\"likeCount\\\": 4400, \\\"commentCount\\\": 500 }`\\n    *   For Medium: `{ \\\"clapCount\\\": 1500, \\\"responseCount\\\": 15 }`\\n*   **`language`** (String): The primary language of the content, using IETF BCP 47 codes (e.g., 'en-US').\\n*   **`media_duration`** (String): For video or audio content, the duration in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `PT1H5M46S` for 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 46 seconds).\\n*   **`license_notes`** (String): Information on the content's license (e.g., 'MIT License', 'Creative Commons URL') or terms of service.\\n*   **`retrieval_date`** (String): The timestamp when the data for this record was collected, in ISO 8601 format. external_podcast_and_interview_appearances Lex Fridman Transcript: DHH interview https://lexfridman.com/dhh-david-heinemeier-hansson-transcript/ The following is a conversation with David Heinemeyer Hansen, also known as DHH.

URLs: https://37signals.com/podcast/q-and-hey-1/ and https://37signals.com/podcast/q-and-hey-2/ Interpreting engagement data requires understanding the nuances of each platform, as direct comparisons are often misleading. Here is a guide to the publicly available metrics and their limitations:\\n\\n**Video Platforms (YouTube, Vimeo):**\\n*   **YouTube:** Publicly displays Views, Likes, and Comments. \\n    *   **Views:** A 'view' is counted when a user intentionally initiates watching a video. YouTube's algorithms filter out low-quality playbacks. For paid ads, a view is counted after 30 seconds of watch time or an interaction. The public view count is often considered a 'vanity metric' because YouTube's internal ranking algorithm prioritizes private metrics like 'watch time' and 'average view duration'.\\n    *   **Likes:** A straightforward metric reflecting user appreciation. The public 'dislike' count was removed in December 2021.\\n*   **Vimeo:** Publicly shows Likes and Comments, but detailed analytics like views are private to the creator.\\n\\n**Blogging Platforms (Medium, HEY World):**\\n*   **Medium:** Publicly displays 'Claps' and 'Responses' (comments). \\n    *   **Claps:** This metric is not a unique count of users. A single user can 'clap' up to 50 times for one article. Therefore, the total clap count can be inflated and is not comparable to a 'like' on other platforms. Key metrics like total Views and Reads are private to the author.\\n*   **HEY World / Signal v. Noise:** These platforms do not have built-in public engagement metrics like likes, claps, or visible comment counts. Engagement can only be inferred externally through social media shares or discussions.\\n\\n**Podcast Platforms (Apple Podcasts, Spotify):**\\n*   **Apple Podcasts:** Publicly shows an average star Rating and the total number of Ratings/Reviews. These are country-specific and do not influence charts. Crucial metrics like Play counts, Download counts, and Follower counts are private.\\n*   **Spotify:** As of May 2025, Spotify displays 'Plays' for episodes, but this is not a precise number. It is shown as milestone markers (e.g., '50K plays') only after an episode surpasses a certain threshold. The actual play count is private. The internal 'Stream' metric (60 seconds of listening) used for monetization is also private.\\n\\n**Challenges of Cross-Platform Comparison:**\\n*   **Incomparable Units:** A YouTube 'view' is defined differently from a Spotify 'play' or a Medium 'read' (which is private). A YouTube 'like' is a single action, while a Medium 'clap' can be up to 50 actions from one person. They cannot be compared numerically.\\n*   **Public vs. Private Data:** Most platforms reserve the most valuable engagement data (watch time, average consumption, unique listeners/readers) for creators' private dashboards. The public metrics are often simplified for general audiences and lack the depth needed for true performance analysis.\\n*   **Conclusion:** When viewing the 'engagement' data, it is essential to consider it on a platform-by-platform basis. For example, you can compare the relative views of two YouTube videos but should not compare YouTube views to Medium claps. The most consistently comparable metric, albeit with its own variations, is the comment count. This dataset was compiled using several important data collection and normalization strategies to ensure its accuracy and completeness.\\n\\n**1. Deduplication and Canonicalization:**\\nDHH and Jason Fried's content often appears on multiple platforms simultaneously (e.g., an article posted on their personal blog, the company blog, and Medium). To avoid redundancy and present a single source of truth, a process of canonicalization was implemented.\\n\\n*   **Canonical Priority:** A hierarchy was established to determine the primary or 'canonical' URL for each piece of content. The priority is as follows:\\n    1.  **Author's/Company's Owned Sites:** The highest priority is given to platforms they directly own and operate, such as `signalvnoise.com` and `dhh.dk`, as these are typically the original sources.\\n    2.  **HEY World Blogs:** Their current primary blogs (`world.hey.com/dhh` and `world.hey.com/jason`) are the next priority, as these pages declare themselves as the canonical source.\\n    3.  **Syndication Platforms (Medium):** Platforms like Medium are treated as the lowest priority, as they were often used for syndication. Content on Medium frequently contains a `rel=\\\"canonical\\\"` HTML tag pointing back to the original source.\\n\\n*   **Detection Methods:** Duplicates were identified using a multi-layered approach:\\n    *   **Explicit Canonical Tags:** Checking for `rel=\\\"canonical\\\"` tags in the HTML.\\n    *   **Content Matching:** Comparing titles, authors, and publication dates across platforms.\\n    *   **Text Similarity:** Using algorithms like Cosine Similarity on the normalized text content to find near-duplicates that may have minor edits.\\n\\n*   **Preserving Engagement:** While duplicates are merged under a single canonical URL, any platform-specific engagement metrics (e.g., claps and responses from a Medium version) are preserved and linked to the canonical record to provide a full picture of the content's reach.\\n\\n**2. Use of Archival Sources (The Wayback Machine):**\\nTo recover older or defunct content, the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine was used extensively. \\n\\n*   **Content Recovery:** The archives for `signalvnoise.com` and DHH's personal blog `dhh.dk` were probed to find posts from the early 2000s that are no longer on the live web.\\n*   **Completeness Verification:** Archived versions of index pages (e.g., `signalvnoise.com/archives`) and RSS/Atom feeds were used to create a master list of 'expected' content. This master list was then used to verify how much of their historical work has been successfully archived and to identify gaps.\\n*   **Data Provenance:** Any content recovered from an archive is clearly marked as such in the dataset, including the specific snapshot date and URL from the Wayback Machine, ensuring data integrity and transparency. The dataset is structured with the following fields for each record. This schema is designed to be comprehensive, providing not only the user-requested information but also additional metadata for deeper analysis.\\n\\n*   **`topic_primary`** (String): The main topic of the content, assigned from a defined taxonomy (e.g., 'Software Engineering/Technology', 'Product Management/Development', 'Calm Company').\\n*   **`topic_secondary`** (String): A secondary topic, if applicable.\\n*   **`name`** (String): The official title or headline of the content item (e.g., the blog post title, video title, or podcast episode name).\\n*   **`content_text`** (String): The full text of the content, such as the body of an article or the transcript of a video or podcast.\\n*   **`summary_1liner`** (String): A concise, 15-30 word summary of the content's core message, written in plain language for a learner.\\n*   **`author`** (String): The name of the content creator (e.g., 'David Heinemeier Hansson', 'Jason Fried').\\n*   **`date_published`** (String): The original publication date and time of the content, in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-08-14T12:00:00Z`).\\n*   **`date_updated`** (String): The date and time the content was last modified, in ISO 8601 format.\\n*   **`url`** (String): The direct URL where the content was retrieved.\\n*   **`canonical_url`** (String): The single, authoritative URL for the content, especially important for items cross-posted on multiple platforms.\\n*   **`source_platform`** (String): The platform where the content is hosted (e.g., 'HEY World', 'YouTube', 'Signal v. Noise', 'Medium', 'Rework Podcast').\\n*   **`type_of_content`** (String): The format of the content (e.g., 'Blog Post', 'Video', 'Podcast Episode', 'Book Summary', 'Gist').\\n*   **`tags`** (Array of Strings): A list of any keywords or tags directly associated with the content on its source platform.\\n*   **`engagement_metrics`** (JSON Object): A structured object containing publicly available engagement data. The structure varies by platform, for example:\\n    *   For YouTube: `{ \\\"viewCount\\\": 140123, \\\"likeCount\\\": 4400, \\\"commentCount\\\": 500 }`\\n    *   For Medium: `{ \\\"clapCount\\\": 1500, \\\"responseCount\\\": 15 }`\\n*   **`language`** (String): The primary language of the content, using IETF BCP 47 codes (e.g., 'en-US').\\n*   **`media_duration`** (String): For video or audio content, the duration in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `PT1H5M46S` for 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 46 seconds).\\n*   **`license_notes`** (String): Information on the content's license (e.g., 'MIT License', 'Creative Commons URL') or terms of service.\\n*   **`retrieval_date`** (String): The timestamp when the data for this record was collected, in ISO 8601 format. external_podcast_and_interview_appearances Lex Fridman Transcript: DHH interview https://lexfridman.com/dhh-david-heinemeier-hansson-transcript/ The following is a conversation with David Heinemeyer Hansen, also known as DHH.
