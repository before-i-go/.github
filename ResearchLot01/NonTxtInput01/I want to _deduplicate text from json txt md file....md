Of course. That is an excellent and robust strategy for deduplication. Building this in Rust is a fantastic idea, as it will be incredibly fast, memory-efficient, and reliable, especially when dealing with large volumes of files.

Your two-stage approach is perfect:

1. **File-level Hashing:** A quick, coarse-grained pass to eliminate wholesale duplicates. This is the low-hanging fruit and saves a lot of unnecessary processing.  
2. **Paragraph-level Hashing with SQLite:** A fine-grained, persistent method to eliminate redundant content *across all files*. Using SQLite is the key hereâ€”it creates a persistent "memory" of every unique paragraph ever seen, so the deduplication becomes more effective over time and across multiple runs.

Let's design and build this Rust application.

### **The Plan: A High-Performance Deduplication Tool in Rust**

We will build a command-line interface (CLI) tool that takes an input directory, an output directory, and a path for the SQLite database.

#### **Core Features:**

* Recursively scans an input directory for .txt, .md, and .json files.  
* Calculates a SHA-256 hash of each file's content to identify and discard exact file duplicates.  
* For unique files, extracts text content (handling the structure of JSON).  
* Splits the text into paragraphs.  
* For each paragraph, calculates a hash and checks it against the SQLite database.  
* If the paragraph's hash is new, it's written to the output file and its hash is inserted into the database.  
* Uses rayon for massive parallelism to process multiple files and paragraphs concurrently.

### **Step 1: Project Setup and Cargo.toml**

First, create a new Rust project: cargo new text\_dedup

Next, configure your Cargo.toml with the necessary crates (libraries) to power our tool.

### **Step 2: The Rust Code (main.rs)**

Here is the complete, well-commented code for the application. It's structured to be readable and showcases Rust's strengths in handling this kind of task.

### **How to Run It**

1. **Save the files:** Make sure Cargo.toml and src/main.rs are in your text\_dedup directory.  
2. **Build in release mode:** This enables optimizations for maximum performance.  
   Bash  
   cargo build \--release  
   3\.  \*\*Run the tool:\*\* Point it to your data.  
   \`\`\`bash  
   \# Create some directories for testing  
   mkdir my\_data  
   mkdir my\_cleaned\_data

   \# Put your .txt, .md, and .json files into the \`my\_data\` directory.

   \# Execute the program  
   ./target/release/text\_dedup \--input-dir ./my\_data \--output-dir ./my\_cleaned\_data

After running, the my\_cleaned\_data directory will contain the processed files, and a dedup.db file will be created in the current directory, storing the hashes of all unique paragraphs found. If you run the tool again with new data, it will use the existing database to avoid re-adding paragraphs it has already seen.
