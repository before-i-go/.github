# Unique Insights Guide - Examples and Evaluation

## Purpose
This guide provides clear examples and evaluation criteria for capturing only truly unique ideas during document processing. The goal is to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio in our backlog.

## The Four Critical Questions
Before capturing ANY insight, ask:
1. **"So what?"** - Does this actually change anything meaningful?
2. **"Who cares?"** - Would anyone find this genuinely valuable?
3. **"What's new?"** - Is this truly original or just recycled knowledge?
4. **"How is this different?"** - What makes this unique from existing approaches?

## Examples: Unique vs Non-Unique Insights

### **Architecture/Technical Domain**

#### ✅ **UNIQUE - First-of-its-kind Framework**
```
Insight: "Hybrid in-memory SQLite with DashMap for <12ms updates, combining immediate queryability with persistent storage without the overhead of traditional databases."
```
**Why it's unique:**
- Novel combination of in-memory + persistent storage
- Specific performance target (<12ms)
- Addresses specific technical constraint
- Could be implemented and measured

#### ❌ **NON-UNIQUE - Generic Advice**
```
Insight: "Use caching to improve application performance."
```
**Why it's not unique:**
- Common knowledge, decades old concept
- No specific implementation details
- Vague and non-actionable
- Everyone already knows this

### **Business/Strategy Domain**

#### ✅ **UNIQUE - Contrarian Business Model**

```
**Why it's unique:**
- Challenges traditional time management
- Specific metric (40% improvement)
- Based on cognitive science principles
- Implementable and measurable

#### ❌ **NON-UNIQUE - Common Productivity Tip**
```
Insight: "Take breaks to maintain productivity throughout the day."
```

- Only capture if exceptionally well-articulated or presented

## Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to quickly evaluate insights:

| Question | Yes | No | Weight |
|----------|-----|----|--------|
| So what? Changes anything meaningful? | 1 | 0 | Critical |
| Who cares? Genuinely valuable? | 1 | 0 | Critical |
| What's new? Truly original? | 1 | 0 | Important |
| How different? Unique approach? | 1 | 0 | Important |
| First-of-kind or novel combination? | 2 | 0 | Bonus |
| Specific and actionable? | 1 | 0 | Important |
| Long-term value? | 1 | 0 | Bonus |

**Score Interpretation:**
- **8-10:** Capture immediately (highly unique)
- **5-7:** Consider carefully (moderately unique)
- **0-4:** Skip (not unique enough)

## Additional Examples: Uncommon Insights & Subtle Patterns

### **Personal/Productivity Domain**

#### ✅ **UNCOMMON INSIGHT (6/10) - Counterintuitive Pattern**
```
Insight: "People who check email first thing in the morning actually report higher focus throughout the day, contrary to productivity dogma, because it reduces anxiety about missing important messages."
```
**Why it's uncommon:**
- Contradicts common productivity advice
- Specific psychological mechanism (anxiety reduction)
- Non-obvious but research-backed finding
- Could change how people structure their day

#### ✅ **USEFUL OBSERVATION (4/10) - Implementation Nuance**
```
Insight: "When taking notes during meetings, drawing simple boxes around key terms creates 25% better recall than using highlighters, because the spatial separation creates stronger visual memory anchors."
```
**Why it's useful:**
- Specific, actionable technique
- Surprising but plausible statistic
- Easy to implement immediately
- Addresses common problem (note retention)

### **Technical/Architecture Domain**

#### ✅ **UNCOMMON INSIGHT (5/10) - Subtle Technical Pattern**
```
Insight: "API versioning schemes that use dates instead of incremental numbers (e.g., /api/2024-09/endpoint) reduce breaking changes by 60% because they naturally accommodate parallel versions without complex routing logic."
```
**Why it's uncommon:**
- Non-obvious solution to common problem
- Specific metric (60% reduction)
- Practical and implementable
- Challenges conventional versioning wisdom

#### ✅ **USEFUL OBSERVATION (3/10) - Practical Implementation Detail**
```
Insight: "Database connection pools perform 30% better when the minimum connections are set to 1 rather than 0, because the overhead of establishing the first connection is often underestimated in benchmarking."
```
**Why it's useful:**
- Specific configuration advice
- Counterintuitive (minimum 1 vs 0)
- Performance-based reasoning
- Immediately applicable by developers

### **Business/Strategy Domain**

#### ✅ **UNCOMMON INSIGHT (6/10) - Subtle Market Pattern**
```
Insight: "B2B startups that target companies with 50-100 employees have 3x higher success rates than those targeting larger enterprises, because decision-makers are more accessible but budgets are still substantial."
```
**Why it's uncommon:**
- Specific market segment insight
- Counterintuitive (smaller is better)
- Quantified advantage (3x success)
- Actionable for business strategy

### **When to Capture Subtle Insights**

#### **CAPTURE (Score 5-6) Uncommon Insights When:**
- Reveals non-obvious connections or patterns
- Provides specific, actionable information
- Challenges conventional wisdom or assumptions
- Offers a "why didn't I think of that?" moment
- Could be valuable in specific contexts or situations

#### **CAPTURE (Score 3-4) Useful Observations When:**
- Provides specific implementation details rarely documented
- Offers context-dependent advice that's actually helpful
- Includes subtle nuances that improve practical application
- Presents common knowledge in a particularly well-articulated way
- Saves others time or prevents common mistakes

## Final Check

Before adding to backlog, ask: "If I told this to an expert in this field, would they:
- Be impressed and want to know more? (Good sign)
- Say 'duh, everyone knows that'? (Bad sign)
- Ask 'where's the innovation?'? (Bad sign)
- Want to implement or build on it? (Good sign)"

If it doesn't pass the expert test, it's probably not unique enough to capture.
