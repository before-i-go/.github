# Keep in mind during each action - task sub task

## DO NOT CHEAT ON THE TASKS - do NOT MARK THEM COMPLETE BY SCRIPTS 

## LAYER 1: Scoring Framework

### Three-Dimensional Evaluation (1-10 scale)

Read lines with your 1000 IQ and reason it to find Rust library or tool opportunities through systematic analysis, targeting libraries with 8-10/10 scores in Testing Ease, PMF Probability, and Differentiation Potential


#### PMF Probability (Product-Market Fit)
- **9-10**: Critical widespread pain points, developers actively searching
- **7-8**: Common problems with clear market demand
- **5-6**: Nice-to-have solutions for niche audiences
- **1-4**: Limited market need or novelty

#### Ease of Testing
- **9-10**: Deterministic behavior, clear I/O, comprehensive test coverage possible
- **7-8**: Testable with setup, manageable complexity
- **5-6**: Testing possible but complex/integration-heavy
- **1-4**: Difficult to test reliably, non-deterministic

#### Differentiation Potential
- **9-10**: Truly innovative, no direct competitors, 10x improvement
- **7-8**: Clear advantages, unique features/approaches
- **5-6**: Incremental improvements over existing solutions
- **1-4**: Me-too products, crowded space

### Content Relevance Filter

#### ANALYZE (Programming-focused content)
Systems programming, developer tools, performance optimization, runtime analysis, web architectures, databases, security tools, build systems, memory safety, concurrency, cross-language integration

#### SKIP (Non-programming content)
Medical/health, entertainment, non-technical research, personal development


# IMPORTANT
All use cases will be appended to ResearchLot01/Output01/use-case-202509.md using proper file operations





## METHODOLOGY UPDATE: LIBRARY CONCEPT EXTRACTION THRESHOLD

### **REVISED SCORING CRITERIA**
- **Minimum Threshold**: 5/10 on ALL three dimensions (reduced from 8/10)
- **Three-Dimensional Framework**: PMF Probability, Ease of Testing, Differentiation Potential
- **Content Filter**: Systems programming, developer tools, performance optimization only
- **Documentation**: 5-liner descriptions + parallel analysis

### **RATIONALE FOR THRESHOLD ADJUSTMENT**
- **Broader Discovery**: Lower threshold enables discovery of more library opportunities
- **Incremental Value**: Concepts scoring 5-7/10 may have niche applications or serve as building blocks
- **Market Reality**: Not all successful libraries need to score 8-10/10 across all dimensions
- **Progress Optimization**: Prevents analysis stagnation on technical content with moderate opportunity

### **QUALITY ASSURANCE**
- **Documentation Standards**: 5-line descriptions remain mandatory
- **Parallel Analysis**: Comparative analysis with existing solutions required
- **Domain Filtering**: Still focused on systems programming and developer tools
- **Progress Tracking**: Terminal-based verification and reporting maintained

### **IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Immediate Effect**: Applied to all future chunk analysis
- **Retrospective**: Previous high-threshold analysis stands, new threshold going forward
- **Monitoring**: Track quality and quantity of extracted concepts with new criteria
