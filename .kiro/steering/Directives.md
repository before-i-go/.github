## LAYER 1: Scoring Framework

### Three-Dimensional Evaluation (1-10 scale)

Read lines with your 1000 IQ and reason it to find Rust library or tool opportunities through systematic analysis, targeting libraries with 8-10/10 scores in Testing Ease, PMF Probability, and Differentiation Potential


#### PMF Probability (Product-Market Fit)
- **9-10**: Critical widespread pain points, developers actively searching
- **7-8**: Common problems with clear market demand
- **5-6**: Nice-to-have solutions for niche audiences
- **1-4**: Limited market need or novelty

#### Ease of Testing
- **9-10**: Deterministic behavior, clear I/O, comprehensive test coverage possible
- **7-8**: Testable with setup, manageable complexity
- **5-6**: Testing possible but complex/integration-heavy
- **1-4**: Difficult to test reliably, non-deterministic

#### Differentiation Potential
- **9-10**: Truly innovative, no direct competitors, 10x improvement
- **7-8**: Clear advantages, unique features/approaches
- **5-6**: Incremental improvements over existing solutions
- **1-4**: Me-too products, crowded space

### Content Relevance Filter

#### ANALYZE (Programming-focused content)
Systems programming, developer tools, performance optimization, runtime analysis, web architectures, databases, security tools, build systems, memory safety, concurrency, cross-language integration

#### SKIP (Non-programming content)
Medical/health, entertainment, non-technical research, personal development
