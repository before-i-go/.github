# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the systematic analysis work needed to complete discovering high-PMF Rust libraries. The work involves manually analyzing 111 files in ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/ using 1000-line chunks, extracting library concepts, and scoring them on three dimensions. The goal is to complete all the checkboxes in ResearchLot01/Progress01/use-case-analysis.md and compile results in ResearchLot01/Output01/use-case-202509.md using echo commands only.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Chunk Analysis for All Files

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to systematically analyze all remaining files in ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/ in 1000-line chunks using terminal-based progress tracking, so that I can extract all potential Rust library concepts from the research content while maintaining data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a chunk THEN I SHALL read 250-500 lines at a time due to token limits
2. WHEN content is programming-relevant (systems programming, developer tools, WASM/Rust, React patterns) THEN I SHALL extract library concepts with 5-line descriptions
3. WHEN content is non-technical (medical, entertainment, business strategy) THEN I SHALL mark the chunk as [s] skipped with reasoning
4. WHEN a chunk is complete THEN I SHALL mark the checkbox as [x] in use-case-analysis.md
5. WHEN all chunks for a file are done THEN I SHALL update the file status and move to next file
6. WHEN tracking progress THEN I SHALL use terminal commands to verify completion counts and maintain repository integrity

### Requirement 2: Score Library Concepts on Three Dimensions with Quality Threshold

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to score each extracted library concept on PMF Probability, Ease of Testing, and Differentiation Potential using a rigorous 1-10 scale, so that I can identify only the most promising opportunities that score 8-10/10 in all three dimensions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scoring PMF Probability THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on developer pain points and market demand (9-10 for critical widespread pain points)
2. WHEN scoring Ease of Testing THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on deterministic behavior and test coverage potential (9-10 for deterministic, clear I/O)
3. WHEN scoring Differentiation Potential THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on innovation and competitive advantages (9-10 for truly innovative, 10x improvement)
4. WHEN scoring is complete THEN I SHALL only keep concepts scoring 8-10/10 in ALL three dimensions
5. WHEN documenting scores THEN I SHALL provide detailed reasoning for each dimension following the framework criteria

### Requirement 3: Document Use Cases with Technology Domain Categorization

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to document each library concept with detailed descriptions, parallel analysis, and technology domain categorization, so that I can build a comprehensive catalog organized by React, WASM/Rust, Systems Programming, and other domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting a concept THEN I SHALL write a 5-line description capturing core problem, solution approach, technical features, use cases, and benefits
2. WHEN adding parallel analysis THEN I SHALL show how similar concepts exist in other domains
3. WHEN categorizing concepts THEN I SHALL group by technology domain (React Ecosystem, WASM/Rust Performance, Programming Languages, Runtime Systems, Zig Patterns, Systems Programming, Developer Tools)
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN I SHALL append findings to ResearchLot01/Output01/use-case-202509.md using proper file operations
5. WHEN formatting results THEN I SHALL maintain the structured format with Domain, Source, Description, Scoring, and Parallel Analysis sections

### Requirement 4: Terminal-Based Results Compilation

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to compile all findings by appending to the output file, so that I can maintain data integrity and avoid manual editing while building the comprehensive use case catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling results THEN I SHALL append content to ResearchLot01/Output01/use-case-202509.md using proper file operations
2. WHEN adding concepts THEN I SHALL never edit the file manually, only append new content
3. WHEN structuring output THEN I SHALL include concept title, domain, source file/lines, 5-line description, scoring with reasoning, and parallel analysis
4. WHEN categorizing THEN I SHALL organize findings by technology domains for strategic analysis
5. WHEN completing analysis THEN I SHALL ensure all high-scoring concepts are documented with comprehensive details for Rust library development priorities
