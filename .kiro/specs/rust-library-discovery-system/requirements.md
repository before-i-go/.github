# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the systematic analysis work needed to complete the SOPv1 methodology for discovering high-PMF Rust libraries. The work involves manually analyzing 111 files in ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/ using 1000-line chunks, extracting library concepts, and scoring them on three dimensions. The goal is to complete all the checkboxes in ResearchLot01/Progress01/use-case-analysis.md and compile results in ResearchLot01/Output01/.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Chunk Analysis for All Files

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to systematically analyze all remaining files in ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/ in 1000-line chunks, so that I can extract all potential Rust library concepts from the research content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a chunk THEN I SHALL read 250-500 lines at a time due to token limits
2. WHEN content is programming-relevant THEN I SHALL extract library concepts with 5-line descriptions
3. WHEN content is non-technical THEN I SHALL mark the chunk as skipped with reasoning
4. WHEN a chunk is complete THEN I SHALL mark the checkbox as [x] in use-case-analysis.md
5. WHEN all chunks for a file are done THEN I SHALL update the file status and move to next file

### Requirement 2: Score Library Concepts on Three Dimensions

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to score each extracted library concept on PMF Probability, Ease of Testing, and Differentiation Potential, so that I can identify the most promising opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scoring PMF Probability THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on developer pain points and market demand
2. WHEN scoring Ease of Testing THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on deterministic behavior and test coverage potential  
3. WHEN scoring Differentiation Potential THEN I SHALL rate 1-10 based on innovation and competitive advantages
4. WHEN scoring is complete THEN I SHALL only keep concepts scoring 8-10/10 in all three dimensions
5. WHEN documenting scores THEN I SHALL provide detailed reasoning for each dimension

### Requirement 3: Document Use Cases with Parallel Analysis

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to document each library concept with detailed descriptions and parallel analysis, so that I can build a comprehensive catalog of opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting a concept THEN I SHALL write a 5-line description capturing the core idea
2. WHEN adding parallel analysis THEN I SHALL show how similar concepts exist in other domains
3. WHEN categorizing concepts THEN I SHALL group by technology domain (React, WASM/Rust, etc.)
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN I SHALL append findings to ResearchLot01/Output01/use-case-202509.md
5. WHEN formatting results THEN I SHALL maintain consistent structure for easy comparison

### Requirement 4: Use Terminal Commands for Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to track my progress using only terminal commands, so that I maintain data integrity and follow SOPv1 methodology exactly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking progress THEN I SHALL use `grep -c "\[x\]" ResearchLot01/Progress01/use-case-analysis.md` for completed chunks
2. WHEN checking remaining work THEN I SHALL use `grep -c "\[ \]" ResearchLot01/Progress01/use-case-analysis.md` for pending chunks  
3. WHEN monitoring files THEN I SHALL use `find ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/ -name "*.txt" | wc -l` for file counts
4. WHEN checking repository status THEN I SHALL use `./SOP/tree-with-wc.sh` for comprehensive statistics
5. WHEN updating progress THEN I SHALL never manually edit tracking files, only use terminal commands

### Requirement 5: Complete All Analysis Tasks

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to complete all remaining analysis tasks in the use-case-analysis.md file, so that I finish the systematic discovery of Rust library concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting analysis THEN I SHALL work through files in order from largest to smallest
2. WHEN analyzing RustConcepts20250909.txt THEN I SHALL complete all 53 chunks (52,171 lines total)
3. WHEN analyzing other large files THEN I SHALL complete all their respective chunks systematically  
4. WHEN all files are analyzed THEN I SHALL have 100% completion in use-case-analysis.md
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN I SHALL compile final results in ResearchLot01/Output01/
