# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a collection of simple, high Product-Market Fit (PMF) Rust libraries inspired by the comprehensive technical analyses found in the JSON202509 directory. Each library will be under 500 lines of code and focus on solving specific, well-defined problems that developers frequently encounter. The libraries will be designed for maximum utility, ease of use, and adoption potential.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want access to a curated collection of small, focused libraries that solve common problems, so that I can quickly integrate proven solutions into my projects without reinventing the wheel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer browses the library collection THEN they SHALL find at least 5 distinct libraries covering different problem domains
2. WHEN a developer examines any library THEN the library SHALL contain fewer than 500 lines of code including documentation
3. WHEN a developer reads the library documentation THEN they SHALL understand the problem it solves within 2 minutes
4. WHEN a developer wants to use a library THEN they SHALL be able to integrate it with a single `cargo add` command

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want each library to follow consistent patterns and quality standards, so that the collection maintains high quality and developer trust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation with examples
2. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL include unit tests with at least 80% code coverage
3. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL follow idiomatic Rust patterns and conventions
4. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL have a clear, focused API with minimal dependencies
5. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL include proper error handling using `Result` types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer researching solutions, I want libraries that address real-world problems identified in technical analyses, so that I can trust they solve actual pain points rather than theoretical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is designed THEN it SHALL address a specific problem domain identified in the JSON202509 analyses
2. WHEN a library is designed THEN it SHALL solve a problem that appears in multiple technical contexts
3. WHEN a library is designed THEN it SHALL provide measurable improvements over existing solutions or fill a clear gap
4. WHEN a library is designed THEN it SHALL target problems that have high frequency of occurrence in real projects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating libraries, I want clear performance characteristics and benchmarks, so that I can make informed decisions about adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library has performance implications THEN it SHALL include benchmark tests
2. WHEN a library has performance implications THEN it SHALL document time and space complexity
3. WHEN a library provides performance benefits THEN it SHALL include comparison benchmarks against alternatives
4. WHEN a library is performance-critical THEN it SHALL use `#[inline]` and other optimization hints appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working in different environments, I want libraries that are portable and work across different platforms and use cases, so that I can use them consistently across my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL support `no_std` environments where applicable
2. WHEN a library is created THEN it SHALL work on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. WHEN a library uses external dependencies THEN it SHALL minimize them and justify their necessity
4. WHEN a library provides async functionality THEN it SHALL be runtime-agnostic (tokio, async-std, etc.)
