- **5-liner**: A Rust library that provides intelligent React Compiler integration, analyzing components for automatic optimization opportunities, detecting memoization candidates, and providing migration assistance from manual memoization to compiler-based optimization.
- **Parallels**: Similar to React Compiler but with enhanced analysis, like build-time optimization assistants

#### Use Case 61: Advanced ESLint Rule Generator for React
- **PMF Probability**: Medium-High (7/10) - Custom ESLint rules are needed for team standards
- **Ease of Testing**: High (8/10) - Clear rule validation and testing patterns
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that generates custom ESLint rules for React projects, analyzing code patterns and creating team-specific rules for hooks, components, performance, and architecture with automated testing and validation.
- **Parallels**: Similar to eslint-plugin-react but customizable, like rule generation frameworks

#### Use Case 62: React Hook Dependency Optimizer
- **PMF Probability**: High (8/10) - Hook dependency management is a constant pain point
- **Ease of Testing**: High (9/10) - Clear dependency analysis and optimization
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that optimizes React hook dependency arrays, detecting missing dependencies, preventing infinite loops, suggesting useCallback/useMemo optimizations, and providing intelligent dependency management.
- **Parallels**: Similar to exhaustive-deps but more intelligent, like automated hook optimization tools
