## Major Research Themes

### RustHallows Ecosystem - Core Architecture

**Core Idea**: A vertically integrated, four-layer Rust ecosystem targeting 10-40x performance gains through specialized OS primitives and zero-cost abstractions.

**Technical Details**:
- **Layer 1 - Real-time Partition OS**: Microkernel inspired by unikernels, provides hardware-level isolation and deterministic communication primitives. Uses CPU core partitioning (e.g., 4 cores for application, 2 for Linux kernel) to eliminate OS jitter.
- **Layer 2 - Specialized Schedulers**: Application-specific schedulers optimized for Backend APIs, UI rendering, Database operations, and Kafka-style messaging.
- **Layer 3 - Custom Frameworks**: Rust-native implementations including Rails-inspired backend framework, React-inspired UI framework with DOM-free browser engine, OLAP/OLTP databases, and Kafka-inspired messaging.
- **Layer 4 - Parseltongue DSL**: Macro-driven domain-specific language with extensions (Basilisk for APIs, Nagini for UI, Slytherin for messaging).

**Performance Claims**: 
- Targeting 10-40x multiplicative performance gains
- Eliminates OS-induced jitter through core partitioning
- Zero runtime overhead through compile-time DSL optimization

**Use Cases**: 
- High-performance backend APIs requiring predictable latency
- Real-time UI rendering without DOM/HTML/CSS/JS overhead
- Database systems with specialized OLAP/OLTP optimizations
- Low-latency messaging systems
