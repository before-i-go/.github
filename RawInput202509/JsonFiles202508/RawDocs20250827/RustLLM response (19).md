Key Takeaways  

• Core Pinning  
  Bind latency-critical threads to fixed physical cores and disable SMT for those cores. This removes OS migration jitter and guarantees each partition an exclusive execution context, a technique already used by DPDK and high-frequency trading engines.

• Cache Isolation  
  Apply Intel CAT/AMD QoS to dedicate specific LLC ways per partition, preventing cross-tenant eviction and stabilising tail latency. Proven effective in Facebook’s Rosetta inference pipeline (CPU edition) and Aerospike’s low-jitter mode.

• SIMD Vectorization  
  Rewrite hot loops with explicit `std::arch::*` intrinsics or auto-vectorised iterators (`packed_simd_2`). Columnar scans, JSON parsing, and checksum routines typically see 4–10× speed-ups on AVX-512 capable CPUs.

• Branchless Algorithms  
  Replace unpredictable branches with arithmetic masks (e.g., computing min/max, filtering) to avoid µop cache misses and branch mis-predictions. This pattern underpins Google’s SwissTable and Intel’s IPSec implementations.

• Lock-Free Structures  
  Use epoch-based reclamation (`crossbeam_epoch`) and atomic rings to build Bw-tree indexes, MPMC queues, and log brokers that scale linearly across sockets. Gains: 2–3× throughput versus mutex-protected designs under high contention.

• Zero-Copy Pipes  
  Leverage io_uring with `FIXED_FILE` and huge pages to stream data between storage and user space without intermediate copies. Dropbox reported 30 % CPU reduction in their Rust-based pipeline after adopting this model.

• Static Scheduling  
  Embed earliest-deadline-first (EDF) or rate-monotonic parameters directly in the binary via macros so the kernel enforces deadlines without runtime negotiation—mirroring the proven ARINC 653 model used in avionics RTOSes.

• Data-Oriented Layout  
  Store structs of arrays (SoA) for entity components, time-series blocks, and analytics facts. Better cacheline utilisation yields 3–5× speed-ups, as evidenced by ClickHouse’s flat compressed columns.

• Software Prefetch  
  Insert `prefetch_read_data` hints 200–300 cycles ahead in sequential scans and hash joins. Twitter’s Pelikan cache observed a 15 % p99 latency drop on Milan CPUs by tuning these distances experimentally.

• Compile-Time Specialisation  
  Generate monomorphised request handlers and query plans via `const fn` and procedural macros (e.g., `sqlx::query!`). Eliminating virtual dispatch shaved 25 % off CPU cycles in an internal Azure Functions Rust prototype.

These CPU-centric techniques—core dedication, cache carving, SIMD, branch elimination, lock-free concurrency, zero-copy I/O, real-time scheduling, data-oriented design, prefetch tuning, and compile-time specialisation—deliver multiplicative performance gains today without touching GPUs, predictive heuristics, or quantum hardware.
