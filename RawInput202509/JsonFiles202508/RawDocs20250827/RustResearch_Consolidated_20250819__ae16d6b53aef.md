## Ideas & Insights Table

| Category | Concept/Idea | Technical Details | Performance/Business Impact | Implementation Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Real-Time OS** | CPU Core Partitioning | Dedicate specific CPU cores to application (e.g., 4 cores) while reserving others for Linux kernel (e.g., 2 cores) | Eliminates OS jitter, provides deterministic performance | Inspired by unikernels and real-time systems |
| **Scheduling** | Application-Specific Schedulers | Specialized schedulers optimized for Backend APIs, UI rendering, Database operations, Kafka-style messaging | Optimized performance for specific workload patterns | Each scheduler tuned for different latency/throughput requirements |
| **Browser Engine** | DOM-Free UI Framework | Browser engine without DOM, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript - pure Rust rendering | Eliminates web stack overhead, enables predictable UI performance | Direct GPU rendering, no web compatibility layer |
| **DSL Design** | Parseltongue Macro Language | Declarative DSL with extensions: Basilisk (APIs), Nagini (UI), Slytherin (messaging) | Zero runtime overhead through compile-time optimization | Verbose keywords for LLM readability (let_cow_var, let_mut_shared_var) |
| **Performance** | 10-40x Performance Gains | Multiplicative performance improvements through vertical integration | Massive TCO reduction, infrastructure cost savings | Targets specific domains rather than general-purpose computing |
