## **I. Anatomy of a Modern Desktop Application: The Obsidian Architecture**

An effective analysis of any software application must begin with a foundational understanding of its architecture. Before any attempt can be made to "figure out the code," it is imperative to first identify what that code is, how it is constructed, and how it is delivered to the end-user. In the case of Obsidian.md, what presents as a sleek, native desktop application is, in fact, a sophisticated web application meticulously packaged for execution on desktop operating systems. This architectural choice is the single most critical factor that defines the entire strategy for its deconstruction. The process is not one of traditional decompilation of machine code, but rather one of extraction, interpretation, and analysis of web-standard assets.

### **The Electron Foundation: A Web App on the Desktop**

The technological bedrock of the Obsidian desktop application is the Electron framework.1 Electron is an open-source framework that enables the development of desktop GUI applications using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.4 It achieves this by bundling two core components into a single, cross-platform runtime: the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime environment.3 Chromium is the open-source browser project from which Google Chrome is derived, providing the entire front-end rendering layer. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser, providing powerful back-end capabilities, most notably for this context, direct access to the host operating system's filesystem.3

This architectural decision has profound implications for any analysis effort. It means that the core application logic—the code that handles note creation, linking, plugin management, and the rendering of the user interface—is not compiled into opaque, platform-specific machine code (like a C++ or Rust application). Instead, it exists as a collection of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files, assets that are interpreted at runtime.1 This immediately reframes the user's query about "decompilation." The task is not to reverse-engineer a compiled binary but to access and read these web-based source files.

The choice of Electron is deeply intertwined with Obsidian's core philosophy of being a "local-first" application where users retain full ownership and control of their data.6 Unlike a traditional web application that runs in a sandboxed browser environment with heavily restricted access to local files, an Electron application leverages its embedded Node.js runtime to interact directly with the local filesystem.3 This is what allows Obsidian to operate on a simple folder of Markdown files—the "vault"—stored directly on the user's device, a key feature that underpins its promise of data longevity and user control.1

While powerful, the Electron framework is not without its critics, and understanding these critiques provides context for why a user might be motivated to inspect the application's behavior. Electron applications have a reputation for being resource-intensive, particularly regarding RAM usage, as each application essentially packages and runs its own instance of a web browser.2 Security is another area of frequent discussion; because Electron apps have greater system privileges than sandboxed web pages, vulnerabilities in the application's code or its dependencies can potentially pose a greater risk.10 Developers are often aware of the platform's reputation, and some may be hesitant to advertise their use of it.11 However, the Obsidian team has been open about their technology choice, which is a testament to their confidence in their implementation and their focus on the cross-platform development benefits that Electron provides.

### **A Hybrid Technology Stack: Languages and Libraries**

While Electron provides the runtime, the application itself is built from a specific combination of programming languages and third-party libraries. The primary language used for Obsidian's development is TypeScript, with some legacy JavaScript also present.5 TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which helps in managing large codebases and catching errors during development. Ultimately, all TypeScript code is transpiled into standard JavaScript to be executed by the Electron runtime. In addition to this core web stack, developers have confirmed the use of small amounts of native code—specifically C++, Swift, and Java—for mobile-specific features and performance optimizations on desktop platforms, such as for the graph view algorithm and filesystem access on Android.5

The selection of third-party libraries reveals a deliberate focus on performance and user experience. Forum discussions with the developers have shed light on several key components 13:

* **CodeMirror:** A versatile and powerful in-browser code editor that serves as the foundation for Obsidian's Markdown editor.  
* **markdown-it:** A highly extensible and fast Markdown parser responsible for converting Markdown syntax into HTML for rendering.  
* **PIXI.js:** A 2D rendering library that uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics. This was a strategic choice for rendering Obsidian's signature graph view. The developers noted that they initially used D3.js for both force-simulation physics and SVG-based rendering, but found its performance to be "subpar for thousands of notes." Switching to PIXI.js for the rendering component resulted in a significantly faster and more responsive graph view.13  
* **Other Libraries:** The application also incorporates other well-known libraries for specific functionalities, including Moment.js for date and time manipulation, MathJax 3 for rendering mathematical equations, pdf.js by Mozilla for displaying PDF files, and Prism for syntax highlighting in code blocks.13

One of the most significant and challenging aspects for an external analyst is the fact that Obsidian does not use a common, off-the-shelf JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. In a discussion on the community forums, a developer confirmed that they use a custom, in-house framework that was "built along the way".2 This has major implications for reverse engineering. Without public documentation or established architectural patterns to rely on, understanding the application's internal structure and logic flow requires a much deeper, manual analysis of the code. An analyst cannot simply look for familiar patterns like React components or Vue directives; they must trace the execution flow from the ground up to comprehend how different parts of the application interact.

### **Packaging and Distribution: The AppImage Container**

For the Linux platform, Obsidian is distributed as an AppImage file, which carries the .AppImage extension.14 It is crucial to understand that an AppImage is not a traditional installer. It does not place files in various system directories like a

.deb or .rpm package does. Instead, an AppImage is a single, self-contained file that bundles the application and all its dependencies.16

Technically, an AppImage is a compressed filesystem image—specifically, a SquashFS image—prepended with a small runtime executable.18 When a user executes the AppImage file, this runtime mounts the compressed filesystem image using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) into a temporary, read-only directory.15 It then executes the application's entry point from within this mounted directory. The primary goal of the AppImage format is to be distribution-agnostic, allowing a single file to run on a wide variety of Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux) without requiring installation, modification of the system, or root permissions.14 For the purpose of this analysis, the AppImage is merely the outermost shell—a delivery vehicle for the actual application payload that must be unpacked to proceed.

### **The Core Assets: The ASAR Archive**

Once the AppImage container is opened, the true heart of the Electron application is revealed. The application's source assets—the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other resources—are typically packaged into one or more .asar files.20 The name stands for Atom Shell Archive, a legacy from Electron's original name. An ASAR file is a simple,

tar-like archive format that concatenates all files into a single large file. This was originally done to mitigate issues with long file path names on the Windows operating system and to provide a minor performance improvement by speeding up require() calls for modules within the application.20

Within the Obsidian application bundle, the primary target for analysis is a file named obsidian.asar.22 This archive contains the minified and potentially obfuscated "source code" that the user seeks to understand. It is not a compiled binary but a structured archive of the very web assets that constitute the application. Therefore, the central goal of any static analysis is to extract the contents of this ASAR file. The notion that an Electron application's source code is hidden from users is a common misconception. While it is not presented in a clean, readable format, it is fundamentally accessible. This reality means that the term "closed source" for an Electron application like Obsidian is primarily a

*legal distinction* defined by its license agreement, rather than a significant *technical barrier* to inspection. The process of accessing the code is not one of complex decompilation but of straightforward extraction and code formatting.

### **Table 1: Obsidian Technology Stack and Analysis Implications**

To provide a strategic overview, the following table connects each core technology component of Obsidian to its direct implication for the deconstruction effort. This serves as a roadmap for the analysis that follows.

| Technology Component | Description | Implication for Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Electron** | A framework bundling Chromium and Node.js to run web apps on the desktop.3 | The application's logic is primarily in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, not a compiled binary. Analysis targets these web assets, making traditional decompilation unnecessary. |
| **AppImage** | A self-contained package format for Linux, consisting of a compressed SquashFS filesystem.14 | This is the outermost container. The first step of static analysis is to extract its contents using the \--appimage-extract command to access the application bundle within. |
| **ASAR Archive** | A tar-like archive (obsidian.asar) that bundles the application's source files (JS, HTML, CSS, etc.).20 | This is the primary target containing the core application logic. It must be unpacked using a dedicated ASAR utility to access the individual source files. |
| **TypeScript/JavaScript** | The primary languages for application logic, with TypeScript transpiled to JavaScript for execution.5 | The unpacked code will be JavaScript, likely minified and uglified. Analysis requires "beautifying" the code for readability, not decompiling it from machine code. |
| **Custom JS Framework** | An in-house, proprietary JavaScript framework developed by the Obsidian team.2 | There is no public documentation. Understanding the application's architecture requires manual tracing of function calls and logic flow, as known framework patterns do not apply. |
| **Third-Party Libraries** | Specific libraries like PIXI.js (graph view), CodeMirror (editor), and markdown-it (parser).13 | The presence of these known libraries helps to identify which sections of the unpacked code correspond to specific, well-defined features, providing landmarks in an otherwise unfamiliar codebase. |

## **II. Static Analysis: Unpacking the Codebase from the AppImage**

Static analysis involves examining the application's files without executing them. The objective is to dissect the application package, extract its constituent parts, and make the underlying code readable for inspection. This process for Obsidian is a multi-phase operation that moves systematically from the outer distribution container to the core logical assets. It reveals a deliberate, layered approach to intellectual property protection that prioritizes creating inconvenience for the analyst over implementing true, unbreakable security. The barriers are present, but they are all surmountable with standard, publicly available tools.

### **Phase 1: Breaching the Container (AppImage Extraction)**

The first step in the static analysis of Obsidian on Linux is to unpack the AppImage file. This procedure extracts the self-contained filesystem from the distribution package into a standard directory structure, making its contents accessible.

**Prerequisites:**

* A Linux-based operating system.  
* The Obsidian AppImage file, downloaded from the official website (e.g., Obsidian-1.5.8.AppImage).

Procedure:  
The primary and most direct method for extraction involves using a command-line flag built into the AppImage runtime itself.

1. **Make the AppImage executable:** The downloaded file may not have execution permissions by default. These must be granted using the chmod command in a terminal.16  
   Bash  
   chmod \+x Obsidian-1.5.8.AppImage

2. **Run the extraction command:** Execute the AppImage file with the \--appimage-extract parameter. This instructs the runtime to unpack its contents into a new directory instead of running the application.23

./Obsidian-1.5.8.AppImage \--appimage-extract  
\`\`\`  
Expected Outcome:  
Executing this command will create a new directory in the current location named squashfs-root.24 This directory contains the complete, extracted file hierarchy of the application bundle. Its structure will resemble a standard Linux filesystem layout, with subdirectories such as  
/usr, /bin, and /lib.19 Within this structure, one will find the main Obsidian executable, all required shared libraries, and the resource files—including the critical ASAR archive that is the target of the next phase.

For analysts who wish only to inspect the contents without a full extraction, alternative methods are available. It is possible to mount the AppImage file as a read-only loop device using the mount command. This requires determining the correct offset for the SquashFS image within the file, a process which can be done using the \--appimage-offset flag or by calculating it from the ELF header information.25 However, for the purpose of full codebase analysis, the

\--appimage-extract method is the most straightforward and recommended approach.

### **Phase 2: Unpacking the Core Logic (ASAR Extraction)**

With the AppImage's filesystem extracted to the squashfs-root directory, the next objective is to locate and unpack the ASAR archive, which contains the application's core logic.

Locating the Target:  
Navigating through the squashfs-root directory will reveal the application's resources. While the exact path may vary slightly between versions, the target files are the .asar archives. In the case of Obsidian, there are typically two: app.asar and a much larger obsidian.asar.22 The  
obsidian.asar file is the primary target, as it contains the vast majority of the application's JavaScript and HTML source files.

Prerequisites:  
The standard and officially supported tool for manipulating ASAR archives is part of the Electron ecosystem and requires Node.js and its package manager, npm, to be installed on the system.21  
Procedure:  
The recommended method uses npx, a package runner tool included with npm, which executes the @electron/asar package without requiring a permanent global installation.28

1. Navigate into the directory containing the obsidian.asar file within squashfs-root.  
2. Execute the extraction command:  
   Bash  
   npx @electron/asar extract obsidian.asar obsidian-unpacked

   This command instructs the ASAR utility to unpack the contents of obsidian.asar into a new directory named obsidian-unpacked.

Alternative Tools:  
For analysts who do not have a Node.js environment or prefer alternative tools, several options exist:

* **Asar7z:** A plugin for the popular 7-Zip archiving utility that allows users to open, browse, and extract ASAR archives directly through the 7-Zip graphical interface or command line.28  
* **WinAsar:** A lightweight, portable GUI utility for Windows that can pack and extract ASAR files.30  
* **fast-asar:** A command-line tool available via npm that claims to offer faster performance for packing and extracting ASAR archives compared to the official tool.31

This layered approach—placing the core assets inside an ASAR archive, which is itself inside an AppImage container—is not a robust security measure. Both the AppImage and ASAR formats are open standards with readily available, officially supported tools for extraction. This structure serves primarily as a packaging and distribution convenience. The real effort to protect the intellectual property lies not in the containers, but in the state of the code within.

### **Phase 3: Interpreting the "Source" Code**

Once the obsidian.asar archive is unpacked, the analyst will have access to the application's file structure, including JavaScript files, HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, and other assets like icons and internationalization files.22 However, one should not expect to find neatly commented, human-readable source code.

The Reality of the Unpacked Code:  
The JavaScript files, which contain the bulk of the application's logic, will be minified and uglified.22 This is an automated process performed during the application's build stage. Minification removes all unnecessary characters, such as whitespace, newlines, and comments, to reduce file size. Uglification renames variables and functions to short, cryptic names (e.g.,  
a, b, t1). The resulting code is functionally identical to the original but extremely difficult for a human to read and understand. This is the primary technical deterrent against reverse engineering. It does not make analysis impossible, but it significantly increases the time and effort required.

Code Beautification:  
The first essential step to making sense of the code is to "beautify" or "prettify" it. This can be done using various tools, such as the popular prettier code formatter or numerous online JavaScript beautifiers. These tools re-introduce indentation and line breaks based on the code's syntax tree, restoring its structural readability. While variable and function names will remain cryptic, the logical flow—loops, conditionals, function calls—becomes traceable.  
Source Maps:  
In some web development workflows, a "source map" file (.js.map) is generated alongside the minified JavaScript. This map file contains information that allows a browser's developer tools to reconstruct and display the original, unminified source code (e.g., the original TypeScript) for debugging purposes. It is extremely unlikely that source maps would be included in a production build of a proprietary application like Obsidian, as this would completely negate the obfuscating effect of minification. Their deliberate exclusion is a standard practice to protect intellectual property.  
Analyzing package.json:  
Among the most valuable files found in the unpacked archive is package.json.22 This is a standard file in Node.js projects that contains metadata about the application. Its  
dependencies and devDependencies sections list all the third-party libraries the project relies on. Examining this file provides a definitive confirmation of the libraries being used (e.g., CodeMirror, PIXI.js, etc.) and can offer clues about the developers' internal build processes and toolchains. This information helps to map known functionalities to specific parts of the obfuscated codebase.

## **III. Dynamic Analysis: Observing the Application in a Controlled Environment**

Static analysis reveals the application's structure and the code it *can* execute. Dynamic analysis, by contrast, involves running the application and observing its behavior in real time to understand what it *actually* does. This approach directly addresses the user's desire to "run it in a VM" and "collect info some telemetry." A comprehensive dynamic analysis provides the means to verify the developer's promises about privacy and local-first operation, moving from a position of trust to one of empirical verification. By using a suite of specialized tools within a controlled environment, an analyst can monitor every file access, every network connection, and even the internal execution flow of the application.

### **Table 2: Dynamic Analysis Toolkit**

The following table serves as a practical field guide, mapping specific analysis goals to the recommended tools and the precise questions each tool can answer during a dynamic analysis of Obsidian.

| Analysis Goal | Recommended Tool(s) | Questions Answered |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Isolate the Analysis Environment** | Virtual Machine (e.g., VirtualBox, VMWare) | How can the analysis be performed without affecting the host system? How can a clean, reproducible state be maintained for testing different scenarios? |
| **Monitor All File Interactions** | strace | Which configuration files are read from or written to? How does Obsidian access the vault's .md files? Are any unexpected temporary files created? How do plugins interact with the filesystem? 32 |
| **Monitor All Network Activity** | nethogs, Wireshark | Does the application "phone home" upon launch? What servers are contacted for update checks or license validation? What is the network traffic pattern for paid services like Sync and Publish? 33 |
| **Intercept & Modify HTTP/S Traffic** | HTTP Toolkit | What specific API endpoints are being called? What is the content of data sent for telemetry or license checks? Can API responses be manipulated to test application behavior under different conditions? 35 |
| **Inspect Internal Logic at Runtime** | Frida | What are the arguments and return values of specific internal JavaScript functions? Can the behavior of functions be modified on-the-fly to observe the effects? 36 |

### **The Analysis Sandbox: A Virtual Machine Environment**

The foundational step for any dynamic analysis is the creation of a secure and controlled sandbox. A Virtual Machine (VM) is the ideal tool for this purpose.

Setup and Best Practices:  
It is recommended to set up a standard Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu LTS, within a virtualization platform like VirtualBox or VMware. This provides a completely isolated environment, ensuring that the analysis activities do not impact the analyst's primary operating system. The VM offers several key advantages:

* **Isolation:** The application runs in a contained space, preventing any unintended modifications to the host system.  
* **Clean State:** A fresh OS installation ensures that no pre-existing configurations or software interfere with the analysis.  
* **Snapshots:** The most powerful feature of VMs for this purpose is the ability to take snapshots. An analyst can take a snapshot of the clean VM, install and run Obsidian, perform a test, and then instantly revert the entire system to the clean state. This allows for rapid, repeatable experiments, such as observing the changes made by installing a specific plugin or logging into a paid service.

For initial testing, it is advisable to configure the VM's network adapter to be disconnected from the internet. This allows for the observation of Obsidian's offline behavior. Subsequently, network access can be enabled to monitor network-dependent actions like update checks and communication with Obsidian's servers.

### **Filesystem Forensics with strace**

strace is a powerful diagnostic and debugging utility on Linux that can trace all system calls made by a process, as well as the signals it receives.38 For analyzing Obsidian, it is an invaluable tool for understanding every interaction the application has with the filesystem.

Core Command and Usage:  
To monitor all file-related activity, the following command can be used to launch the Obsidian AppImage:

Bash

strace \-f \-e trace=file \-o obsidian\_file\_trace.log./Obsidian-1.5.8.AppImage

**Breakdown of the Command:**

* strace: The command itself.  
* \-f: This flag instructs strace to **f**ollow **f**orks. It is essential because Electron applications are multi-process by nature, often spawning separate processes for the main logic, rendering, and GPU acceleration. Without \-f, the trace would only capture the initial parent process.38  
* \-e trace=file: This is a powerful **e**xpression that filters the output to show only system calls related to the filesystem. This includes calls like openat (opening a file), read, write, stat (getting file info), and close.32 This dramatically reduces the noise from other system calls.  
* \-o obsidian\_file\_trace.log: This redirects the verbose **o**utput of the trace to a log file for later, more detailed analysis.40

Analysis of the Trace Log:  
The resulting log file can be searched for key information. For example, an analyst can search for the names of specific notes (.md files) to see the exact sequence of openat, read, and close calls. Searching for the string ENOENT (Error: No such file or directory) can help debug operations where the application is failing to find an expected file.39 This level of detail allows for the verification of how Obsidian manages its vault, configuration files (in  
\~/.config/obsidian), and plugin data.

### **Network Telemetry and Communication Analysis**

A key part of the user's query is to "collect info some telemetry." This requires monitoring the application's network communications to understand what data, if any, is being sent to external servers.

Per-Process Monitoring with nethogs:  
nethogs is a simple, terminal-based tool that groups network traffic by the process that is generating it. It is an excellent first step for network analysis.41 By running  
sudo nethogs in the VM, an analyst can immediately see if the Obsidian process is consuming any bandwidth. It displays the Process ID (PID), user, and program name, along with the sent and received data rates.43 This provides a quick, high-level confirmation of whether the application is communicating over the network.

Deep Packet Inspection with Wireshark:  
For the most detailed network analysis, Wireshark is the industry-standard tool.34 It is a network protocol analyzer that captures and displays all data packets passing over a network interface. While much of Obsidian's traffic to its own services (like Sync, Publish, and license servers) will be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS,  
Wireshark is still immensely useful. It can reveal:

* The IP addresses and domain names of the servers Obsidian is communicating with.  
* The protocols being used (e.g., DNS lookups, TCP handshakes, TLS encrypted application data).  
* The timing and volume of data being transferred.  
* Any unencrypted communications that might be occurring.

HTTP/S Interception with HTTP Toolkit:  
While Wireshark shows the encrypted packets, HTTP Toolkit is a specialized tool designed to look inside them. It acts as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy and is particularly adept at intercepting traffic from Electron applications with minimal configuration.35 By launching Obsidian through HTTP Toolkit, the tool can automatically inject its own trusted root certificate into the application's trust store. This allows it to decrypt, inspect, and even modify all HTTP and HTTPS traffic. An analyst could use this to:

* View the exact content of API requests for license validation or update checks.  
* Examine the metadata sent when using paid services.  
* Manipulate API responses to test how the application handles server errors or unexpected data.  
  This provides the ultimate ground truth regarding what data is being transmitted over the web.

### **Advanced Runtime Instrumentation with Frida**

For the deepest level of dynamic analysis, **Frida** offers unparalleled capabilities. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit that allows an analyst to inject their own JavaScript snippets into a running process.36 This enables the "hooking" of functions within the target application.

Use Case and Application:  
After identifying a potentially interesting function in the minified JavaScript during static analysis (e.g., a function that appears to handle file saving or data encryption for Sync), an analyst can use Frida to attach to the running Obsidian process. They can then write a small script to intercept calls to that specific function. The script could, for example:

* Log the arguments that are passed to the function each time it is called.  
* Log the return value of the function.  
* Modify the arguments or the return value on-the-fly to alter the program's behavior.

This technique effectively bridges the gap between static and dynamic analysis. It allows the analyst to observe the internal state of the application at critical moments, such as viewing the content of a note *before* it gets passed to an encryption function for Obsidian Sync. This provides a level of insight that is impossible to achieve with external monitoring tools alone.

## **IV. The Legal Framework: Navigating the Terms of Service**

While the technical feasibility of deconstructing Obsidian is clear, the permissibility of such actions is governed by a legal framework: the software's End-User License Agreement (EULA), or Terms of Service (ToS). Any analysis must be conducted with a thorough understanding of these terms to ensure the activities remain within legal and ethical bounds. A close examination of Obsidian's ToS reveals a nuanced position that deviates significantly from the boilerplate restrictions found in most proprietary software licenses. This legal posture appears to be a deliberate strategic choice, transforming a potential technical vulnerability into a key component of its community-driven growth model.

### **The General Prohibition Clause**

Like most commercial software, Obsidian's Terms of Service contain a standard clause designed to protect its intellectual property. The terms explicitly state a general prohibition against certain actions. Users agree not to "reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms relevant to the Services or any software, documentation or data related to the Services ('Software')".44

This language is comprehensive and, on its own, would appear to forbid the very static and dynamic analysis techniques detailed in this report. It is a standard legal safeguard intended to prevent users from creating derivative works, cloning the application, or circumventing commercial features. If this were the only relevant clause, any attempt to unpack the ASAR archive would constitute a breach of the agreement.

### **The Critical Exception: The "Plugin Development" Clause**

The most important and unusual part of Obsidian's legal framework is a specific exception carved out of the general prohibition. The terms clarify that the aforementioned restrictions apply, *except* to the extent that such activities are performed "for the sole purpose of developing Third Party Plugins for non-commercial use".44

This clause is the legal linchpin for the entire analysis process. It provides a clear, sanctioned pathway for technically proficient users to inspect the application's internals. The existence of this exception is not accidental; it is a strategic decision by the developers. They recognize that Obsidian's powerful and extensive plugin ecosystem is one of its greatest strengths and a major differentiator in the crowded note-taking market.1 To foster this ecosystem, they must allow plugin developers to understand how the core application works. Creating a complex plugin often requires knowledge of internal APIs, data structures, and events that are not part of the official, documented plugin API. This carve-out provides the legal standing for developers to acquire that knowledge through reverse engineering.

This approach effectively turns a technical reality of the Electron platform—its inherent inspectability—into a strategic asset. Rather than fighting an unwinnable battle to make the code technically inaccessible, the developers have chosen to legally channel the community's curiosity into a productive outlet that directly enhances the value of their product. This fosters a symbiotic relationship with their most advanced users, encouraging them to extend the platform in ways that benefit the entire user base.

### **Operational Guidelines and Ethical Considerations**

The legal framework established by the Terms of Service provides clear operational guidelines for any analyst.

Permissible Use:  
All the techniques described in this report—extracting the AppImage, unpacking the ASAR archive, beautifying the JavaScript, and performing dynamic analysis with tools like strace and HTTP Toolkit—are legally permissible under the ToS, provided that the analyst's stated and actual intent is to gather information for the purpose of developing a non-commercial plugin. This could include:

* Understanding how the core editor works to build a new editing feature.  
* Learning about the data structure of the graph view to create a new visualization.  
* Investigating the application's lifecycle to ensure a plugin loads and unloads correctly.  
* Verifying security and privacy behavior to ensure a plugin handles user data responsibly.

Impermissible Use:  
Conversely, the ToS clearly prohibits using the knowledge gained from this analysis for other purposes. Actions that would constitute a breach of the agreement include:

* Using the discovered source code or architectural patterns to create a competing, clone application.  
* Attempting to circumvent the licensing mechanisms for paid services like Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish to gain access without payment.  
* Identifying and exploiting a security vulnerability for malicious purposes instead of reporting it responsibly.  
* Re-distributing the unpacked and de-obfuscated source code.

The report advocates for operating in good faith and respecting the spirit of the license. The developers have demonstrated a significant degree of trust in their community, not only through this legal exception but also through policies like making the commercial license optional.46 This community-centric model relies on users to act ethically. The provided pathway for inspection should be used for its intended purpose: learning, extension, and security verification, not intellectual property theft or abuse.

## **V. Conclusion: A Synthesized Path Forward**

The central question of whether it is possible to "figure out the code" of a software application like Obsidian.md by examining its Linux AppImage can be answered with a definitive affirmative. The analysis presented in this report demonstrates that not only is this technically feasible, but a specific legal pathway exists within the software's own Terms of Service that permits such an investigation under defined circumstances. The process, however, is not one of traditional decompilation but of systematic extraction and analysis, tailored to the application's modern, web-based architecture.

### **Summary of Feasibility and Methodology**

The deconstruction of Obsidian is entirely achievable through a two-pronged approach that combines static and dynamic analysis techniques.

1. **Static Analysis:** This phase focuses on revealing the application's source code. The methodology is straightforward:  
   * First, the AppImage container is extracted using its built-in \--appimage-extract functionality. This exposes the application's internal file structure.  
   * Second, the core logical assets contained within the obsidian.asar archive are unpacked using a standard ASAR utility.  
   * The result is access to the application's JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. While this code is minified and uglified, it can be made readable with code beautification tools, allowing for an in-depth study of the application's architecture and logic.  
2. **Dynamic Analysis:** This phase focuses on observing the application's runtime behavior to verify its actions. The methodology involves:  
   * Running the application within a controlled and isolated Virtual Machine to prevent side effects and allow for repeatable experiments.  
   * Utilizing a suite of specialized Linux tools to monitor specific activities: strace for all filesystem interactions, nethogs and Wireshark for network traffic analysis, and a dedicated proxy like HTTP Toolkit for decrypting and inspecting HTTPS communications.  
   * For advanced analysis, dynamic instrumentation with a tool like Frida can be used to hook into internal functions and observe the application's state in real time.

### **Recommended Approach for the Researcher**

For an individual seeking to undertake this analysis, a structured workflow is recommended for maximum efficiency and insight:

1. **Begin with the Legal Framework:** Before any technical work begins, the analyst must read and understand the Obsidian Terms of Service, specifically the clauses related to reverse engineering and the exception for plugin development. All subsequent work should be framed by the legally permissible intent of developing a non-commercial plugin.  
2. **Proceed with Static Analysis:** Unpack the AppImage and ASAR archives to gain a complete "map" of the codebase. Spend time beautifying the JavaScript and studying the file structure. Identify key files and functions that appear to correspond to the areas of interest (e.g., file saving, network requests, graph rendering). Analyze the package.json file to understand the application's dependencies.  
3. **Conduct Targeted Dynamic Analysis:** Use the hypotheses formed during static analysis to guide dynamic testing. If a specific function is believed to handle license checks, use HTTP Toolkit to watch the network traffic when that part of the application is used. If the goal is to understand how a note is saved, use strace to monitor the precise sequence of file operations. This targeted approach is far more effective than aimless observation.  
4. **Maintain Ethical Conduct:** Document the research process with the clear goal of plugin development. Respect the intellectual property of the developers. Do not attempt to crack paid features or redistribute proprietary code.

### **Final Admonition**

The ability to deconstruct and analyze Obsidian is a direct consequence of its technological foundation in Electron. The developers have made a strategic choice not to fight this technical reality but to embrace it, creating a legal framework that channels the community's technical curiosity into a thriving plugin ecosystem that benefits all users. The techniques detailed in this report are powerful and provide a transparent view into the application's inner workings, allowing for independent verification of its privacy and security promises. This power, however, comes with a responsibility to use it ethically. The goal of such an analysis should be to learn, to extend the application's functionality, and to contribute to the security and trust of the platform, thereby honoring the unique and successful community-centric model that Obsidian's developers have cultivated.
