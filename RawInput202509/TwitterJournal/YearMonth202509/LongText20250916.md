use case: new greenfield project written using LLMs
- idea 1 - can we compress the code logic to 1% of the actual codebase which we have to write only using interface signatures? Basically Interface-Stub as an architecture spec. Basically a compact JSONL that declares requirements, types, operations, edges, scenarios, guards, policies. It should be able to help us analyze coverage, p99 budgets, idempotency, consistency; pre-code, pre-mortem analysis, invariants, budgets

- idea 2 - three-by-three graph (Nodes:Fn | Type | Trait, Edges: Calls, Interacts, Implements). SigHash IDs find/who_calls/who_implements/who_interacts. Minimal interface graoh,SighHash, blast radius
- idea 3 - Rust based graph operator which is a terminal command which LLMs can call to analyze the graph for simulating behavior before writing code or doing some analysis
- idea 4 - Use SQLlite +JSONL query to return bounded node + terminal slice for context or code-gen\
- idea 5 - Cross-Stack Micro Graph - expand the graph to all stacks with edges like handles, fetches, routes_to,  mounts so UX flows are specd before code
- idea 6 - Mermaid diagram for all relationships of interface signatures to figure out potential bugs by understanding relationships
- idea 7 - Use Obsidian type of visualizations to help us understand the relationships between interface signatures
