# Future Enhancements Backlog

## Overview

This document contains features and requirements that are **deferred from MVP Phase 1** to future development phases. These features were moved from the main requirements document to focus the MVP on **Option 5: "UI-Complete, Files-Disabled MVP"** approach.

**MVP Phase 1 Focus:** Complete professional UI with text-only backend functionality
**Future Phases:** Gradual rollout of file-related features with feature flags

---

## Evolution Strategy and Phases

### Phase 1: Complete UI, Text-Only Backend (MVP - Months 1-2)
```rust
FeatureFlags { 
    files_enabled: false, 
    avatars_enabled: false, 
    opengraph_enabled: false,
    max_file_size: 0,
    search_enabled: true,
    push_notifications: true,
    bot_integrations: true,
}
```
**Focus**: Complete professional UI with text-only functionality
**Cost**: 85-90% reduction, $3-5/month hosting
**Memory**: 30-60MB total (coordination-aware)
**Users**: 100 concurrent users per room

### Phase 2: Enable Avatar Uploads (Month 3)
```rust
FeatureFlags { 
    avatars_enabled: true,
    files_enabled: false,
    opengraph_enabled: false,
    max_file_size: 1_048_576,  // 1MB for avatars
    search_enabled: true,
    push_notifications: true,
    bot_integrations: true,
}
```
**Added**: Avatar upload, image processing, basic file storage
**Cost**: Still 80-85% reduction
**Memory**: 40-80MB total

### Phase 3: Enable Document Uploads (Month 4)
```rust
FeatureFlags { 
    avatars_enabled: true,
    files_enabled: true,
    opengraph_enabled: false,
    max_file_size: 10_485_760,  // 10MB for documents
    search_enabled: true,
    push_notifications: true,
    bot_integrations: true,
}
```
**Added**: Document sharing, file attachments, enhanced processing
**Cost**: 75-80% reduction
**Memory**: 50-100MB total

### Phase 4: Full Feature Parity (Months 5-6)
```rust

    avatars_enabled: true, 
    opengraph_enabled: true,
    max_file_size: 52_428_800,  // 50MB for all files
    search_enabled: true,
    push_notifications: true,
    bot_integrations: true,
}
```
**Added**: Image/video processing, OpenGraph previews, complete Rails parity
**Cost**: 70-75% reduction (still significant savings)
**Memory**: 60-120MB total

### Coordination Considerations for Evolution

#### Phase Transition Coordination
- **Database Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible migrations with feature flags
- **State Migration**: Existing optimistic messages preserved during feature rollout

- **Rollback Safety**: Each phase can be rolled back without data loss

#### Scaling and Reliability Preparation
- **Phase 1**: Establish fault tolerance patterns, monitor reliability metrics
- **Phase 2-3**: Monitor room actor performance, prepare sharding, enhance retry mechanisms for file operations
- **Phase 3-4**: Implement horizontal scaling preparation, distributed coordination patterns
- **Phase 4+**: Multi-instance deployment with shared state coordination, distributed fallback storage

#### Reliability Evolution
- **Phase 1**: Single-instance fault tolerance with local fallback storage
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced retry mechanisms for avatar uploads, file processing circuit breakers
- **Phase 3**: Distributed retry queues, cross-instance state synchronization
- **Phase 4**: Full distributed fault tolerance with external message queues and shared storage

## Decision Log

### Why These Features Were Deferred
1. **Cost Optimization**: MVP focuses on 90-95% cost reduction
2. **Complexity Reduction**: File processing adds significant implementation complexity
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual rollout reduces technical and business risk
4. **User Validation**: Text-only MVP validates core chat functionality first
5. **Professional Appearance**: Complete UI maintains professional look

### Future Decision Points
1. **Phase 2 Timing**: Based on MVP user feedback and adoption
2. **Storage Strategy**: Choose between local storage, S3, or hybrid approach
3. **Processing Architecture**: Decide on sync vs async file processing
4. **Security Implementation**: Choose security libraries and approaches
5. **Performance Targets**: Set specific performance goals for each phase

---

## Conclusion

This backlog ensures that no functionality is lost from the original requirements while allowing the MVP to focus on core chat functionality with maximum cost efficiency. The phased approach provides a clear roadmap for feature development while maintaining the complete professional UI that users expect.

The feature flag architecture built into the MVP ensures that enabling these features will be straightforward and won't require UI redesign, making the evolution path smooth and predictable.
