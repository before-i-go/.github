# Campfire Rust Rewrite Project: Status and LLM Collaboration Analysis

## Current State of the Rust Rewrite

**Architecture & Spec Completion:** The project has established a clear MVP architecture aligned with the original Campfire’s Rails design. After evaluating several approaches, the team chose **Option 5: “UI-Complete, Files-Disabled MVP”** as the basis for the rewrite[\[1\]](file://file-4AjTAMu55eESGcsevDqoGg#:~:text=,95%25%20reduction%20achievable). This means the initial version delivers the full chat experience (all UI and real-time features) while gracefully disabling heavy features like file uploads until a later phase. All planning documentation reflects a strict **Rails-equivalent philosophy** – often termed the “Rails Parity Rule” – where the new Rust implementation replicates Rails behavior exactly and avoids any added complexity that Rails itself didn’t need[\[2\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=,quality%20matching%20Rails%20reliability). The requirements have been thoroughly **finalized and validated** against the Rails codebase. In fact, the requirements document was enhanced to capture the complete sophistication of Rails’s Campfire: it documents \~12 database tables with the same relationships, all relevant controller behaviors, real-time WebSocket channels, etc., ensuring **100% feature parity** with the original app[\[3\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=1.%20%2A%2ADatabase%20Architecture%2A%2A%20,Active%20Storage%20blob%20structure)[\[4\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=The%20requirements%20document%20now%20captures,gaps%20identified%20in%20the%20analysis). Areas that were initially missing (like content filtering, advanced membership rules, OpenGraph preview security) were identified in analysis and subsequently specified in the requirements. As a result, the spec now covers every important detail of Campfire’s functionality, providing a solid contract for the Rust rewrite[\[5\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=match%20at%20L249%20The%20requirements,gaps%20identified%20in%20the%20analysis).

**Key Architecture Decisions:** The rewrite adheres to a **“no coordination complexity”** mandate as a core architectural decision. The design is a single-process **Rust monolith** (Axum web server \+ SQLite DB \+ embedded React front-end) that forgoes any extra layers like message queues or background job servers. All communication is done via direct function calls and simple async tasks, staying within the boundaries of what a Rails monolith would do[\[6\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20%2A%2AAnti). For example, instead of introducing an event bus or distributed workers, the plan uses Tokio spawns for background jobs (e.g. sending a webhook or a push notification), similar to how Rails would use an in-process thread or a simple job queue. The team documented strict **forbidden patterns** (no event buses, no multi-service orchestration, no elaborate state machines) to prevent scope creep[\[7\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=%23%20%2A%2AFORBIDDEN%20PATTERNS%20%28Avoided%29%2A%2A%20,service%20mesh%2C%20or%20distributed%20architecture). Conversely, they defined **mandatory simple patterns** – things like direct SQL calls, in-memory data structures for tracking state, and single-threaded request handling where possible – to enforce this simplicity[\[6\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20%2A%2AAnti). These decisions are clearly influenced by the Rails codebase analysis: the idea is to match Rails’ proven approach, not to design a new architecture from scratch. The chosen structure is therefore very Rails-like: the Rust project is organized into modules analogous to Rails components (e.g. a models module for data models, handlers for HTTP endpoints like controllers, websocket for real-time channel logic, etc.)[\[8\]\[9\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk). This mapping makes it easier to ensure nothing is missed – for instance, for every Rails controller (rooms, messages, users, etc.), there is a corresponding Axum handler in the new system, following the same routing and behavior[\[10\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=,create_message%28%26NewMessage)[\[11\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2A%2ADesign%20Approach%2A%2A%3A%20Simple%20room,Rails%20ActionCable%2C%20no%20coordination%20complexity). Overall, the architecture and spec work completed to date provide a **one-to-one blueprint** from Rails to Rust, with conscious adjustments only where absolutely necessary (e.g. using Rust’s strong typing and async runtime, or handling five identified “gaps” where Rails had known limitations).

**Implementation Progress & Rails Alignment:** With the design in place, the project has moved into implementation of the MVP (dubbed **Campfire MVP 1.0**). The focus for this phase is delivering all real-time chat features with a complete UI, but without files/avatars. According to the task breakdown, the team has already set up the core scaffolding. They initialized the Rust project with minimal dependencies (Axum for HTTP/WebSocket, sqlx for SQLite, Tokio for async, etc.) and established the basic project structure respecting the **50-file limit** (a constraint to keep things simple)[\[12\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,threaded%20logic). They also defined foundational types and schemas early on. For example, **type-safe IDs** were introduced (newtype wrappers like UserId, RoomId, MessageId around primitives) along with Rust structs for **User**, **Room**, **Message** that match the Rails database schema[\[13\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,simple%20error%20handling). An enum for user roles (member, admin, bot) was created to mirror Rails’ role logic[\[13\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,simple%20error%20handling). These decisions ensure compile-time correctness and mirror Rails’s schema (e.g. the Rails app’s roles or boolean admin flags are represented similarly in Rust). The SQLite database has been set up with the same tables/columns as Rails and even includes Rails-like indexes and constraints – notably a **UNIQUE constraint on (client\_message\_id, room\_id)** to prevent duplicate message inserts (this is how Rails avoids duplicate messages when a user accidentally submits twice)[\[14\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20%231%3A%20client_message_id%20Deduplication%2A%2A%20,duplicate%20messages%20from%20rapid%20clicking). This unique index, combined with a small code check, covers **Critical Gap \#1 (client-side message deduplication)** exactly as Rails would[\[14\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20%231%3A%20client_message_id%20Deduplication%2A%2A%20,duplicate%20messages%20from%20rapid%20clicking)[\[15\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20,handle%20concurrent%20updates%20properly).

Many core features have either been implemented or specified in detail and are in progress. The **React front-end** is being built to include all interface components from Campfire – the task list notes *26 CSS files and all interactive UI pieces* will be present[\[16\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,based%20access). Essentially, users shouldn’t visually feel any difference from the Rails version. On the backend, the **rich text messaging** system is underway: the team is integrating the Trix editor for formatting, handling “boosts” and sounds, etc., just like Rails (Campfire) does[\[17\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,WebSocket%20broadcasting%2C%20presence%2C%20typing). **Real-time chat** is a major focus: an ActionCable-inspired WebSocket broadcaster is implemented to handle room subscriptions, message broadcasts, typing indicators, and presence pings[\[18\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm)[\[11\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2A%2ADesign%20Approach%2A%2A%3A%20Simple%20room,Rails%20ActionCable%2C%20no%20coordination%20complexity). The current approach is very much Rails-equivalent – for each chat room, the server keeps a list of WebSocket connections and simply iterates over them to push out new messages (a “fire-and-forget” broadcast). There’s no acknowledgment or message queue; this is intentional to match ActionCable’s semantics (which don’t guarantee delivery)[\[11\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2A%2ADesign%20Approach%2A%2A%3A%20Simple%20room,Rails%20ActionCable%2C%20no%20coordination%20complexity)[\[19\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2ALimitation%20%233%3A%20Best,best%20effort%20like%20Rails). Presence is tracked by a simple in-memory structure counting connections per user, with periodic clean-up – again, exactly how Rails’ PresenceChannel works, allowing brief inaccuracies (like a user appearing online for up to 60 seconds after disconnect)[\[20\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20,presence%20tracking%20with%20connection%20management)[\[21\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2ALimitation%20,). Other features in progress include **room management** (open vs. closed rooms, invites, etc.), **authentication** (session cookies with secure tokens, similar to Rails’ sessions\_controller and using bcrypt for passwords), and **search** (using SQLite FTS5 to replicate Campfire’s full-text search on messages)[\[22\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,MP3%20files%20with%20%2Fplay%20commands). It’s worth noting that even performance-oriented details have been aligned: e.g. enabling WAL mode in SQLite and using a single connection pool, which echoes Rails’ default setup for SQLite and satisfies the goal of \<2MB memory usage with simple concurrency[\[23\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,FTS5%20search).

Crucially, wherever the Rails app had known behaviors or limitations, the Rust rewrite **embraces them to stay aligned**. For example, Rails orders messages by timestamp and doesn’t attempt to globally serialize or perfectly order messages across connections – the Rust version does the same, using created\_at timestamps and accepting that occasionally a message might arrive slightly out-of-order during network hiccups[\[24\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2ALimitation%20,level). Rails ActionCable opens a separate WebSocket for each browser tab (no shared state across tabs); the Rust implementation also treats each connection independently (no complex multi-tab sync)[\[25\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2ALimitation%20%232%3A%20Multi,%3D%20Rails%20behavior). Rails has no built-in guarantee that every WebSocket message reaches the client (clients reconnect and catch up if needed), and so the Rust broadcaster is likewise best-effort, logging failures but not retrying sends[\[19\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2ALimitation%20%233%3A%20Best,best%20effort%20like%20Rails). By documenting and implementing these **Rails-level imperfections** in the new system, the team avoids over-engineering and ensures that if it worked for Campfire in Rails, it will work in Rust the same way[\[26\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=,second%20TTL)[\[27\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=%23%20%2A%2ARails,Rails%20has%20this). In summary, the current state of the rewrite shows a project that has done its homework: the architecture is solidly defined, the specs mirror the original app’s functionality, and initial implementation steps are in line with achieving a Rails-equivalent chat system with the benefits of Rust (performance, safety) and without the baggage of unnecessary complexity.

## How LLMs Have Been Used in the Rewrite (Patterns, Pain Points, and Anti-Patterns)

**Patterns of LLM Usage:** The user has been leveraging Large Language Models as a kind of pair-programmer and assistant architect throughout this project. A clear pattern is the user providing the LLM with extensive context and reference material to guide its output. For instance, during the front-end development, the user supplied a **“React Idiomatic Reference for LLMs”** (over 400 lines of modern React patterns) and an **“Advanced React Patterns 2025”** guide to the model[\[28\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=1.%20,edge%20patterns%2C%20compound%20components%2C%20render). This helped the AI produce React code using hooks and functional components consistent with current best practices, rather than, say, outdated class components or inefficient state management. Similarly on the Rust side, the user compiled comprehensive notes on **idiomatic Rust concurrency, type system usage, and performance patterns**[\[29\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=performance%2C%20and%20maintainability%20patterns%204,Layered%20L1%2FL2%2FL3)[\[30\]](file://file-NWNyffsWgYzQRiY4ZZauAi#:~:text=match%20at%20L340%20,T) and fed this into the LLM. By doing so, they established a shared vocabulary – for example, ensuring the AI knew about the project’s use of newtype IDs, the preference for Arc\<RwLock\<...\>\> for shared state, and other “zero-cost abstraction” techniques. This context-driven approach is a positive usage pattern: it shows the user treating the LLM not as an all-knowing entity, but as a junior developer who needs to be onboarded with the project’s standards and the state-of-the-art techniques. The benefit is evident in the design and code outputs – the AI, armed with these references, has helped draft documents like the architecture specs and even some code snippets in an idiomatic style consistent with the project’s goals.

**Pain Points Encountered:** Using LLMs in a complex rewrite has not been without challenges. One pain point is that the **AI sometimes proposes solutions that conflict with the project’s constraints**, especially the anti-coordination rules. For example, early on it might have suggested introducing an actor system or a background job queue for handling broadcasts – ideas that make sense generally, but violate the **“no extra coordination”** mandate for this MVP. The user had to guard against this by explicitly instructing the AI about the forbidden patterns (e.g. reminding it “do not use a message broker or coordinator, even if it thinks of one”). Maintaining this level of constraint in a lengthy conversation can be difficult – the model may slip and suggest a slight variation of a forbidden pattern, requiring the user to correct or steer it back. Another pain point is ensuring **consistency and correctness across many interactions**. The project’s scope is broad (backend, frontend, deployment, etc.), and the AI’s knowledge can become fragmented. For instance, the AI might define a Message struct in one context, but later forget some fields when generating a database query elsewhere. The user has to constantly provide the AI with the latest definitions or risk it hallucinating fields or missing required data. This adds overhead in prompt management.

Perhaps the biggest practical pain has been achieving **“compile-ready” code generation**. Initially, if the user asked the LLM to implement a large function (say, the entire message broadcasting flow) in one go, the output often needed multiple fixes – missing lifetime annotations, minor type mismatches, or using an API incorrectly. Each round-trip of fixing these errors erodes the time savings of using the AI. The user noticed that without a disciplined approach, the LLM would produce code that *almost* works but not quite, leading to iterative debugging. This is frustrating when the goal is to leverage the AI for speed. It highlighted that the AI excels at producing plausible code, but not guaranteed correct code, especially when the problem or the API surface is complex.

**Underused Opportunities:** Despite heavy use of ChatGPT (or similar models), there are areas where the collaboration could be taken further. One underused opportunity is employing the LLM in a **more test-driven manner**. While the project did adopt TDD on paper (the architecture docs include example unit tests), the workflow with the AI often jumped to implementation before explicitly writing tests. The AI could be utilized to **generate exhaustive test cases and scenarios** early, which would both serve as a guide for implementation and as a check on the AI’s own outputs. For example, the model could help enumerate edge cases for the message system (like “what if two messages have the same timestamp?” or “what if a user tries to send an empty message?”) and create unit tests or property-based tests for those. Currently, there’s no evidence that property-based testing (which the requirements suggest for robust testing) has been fully embraced in AI collaboration. This is a missed chance because LLMs are quite capable of producing the boilerplate for property tests or coming up with a range of random scenarios that a human might not immediately consider. Another opportunity lies in using the LLM for **code review or refactoring suggestions** after initial code is written. The user has mostly used it to draft or analyze, but the AI could also be prompted to critique a function (“Does this function follow our error-handling pattern and will it scale?”). This hasn’t been utilized much yet, but could greatly help in improving code quality proactively.

**LLM Usage Anti-Patterns:** A few anti-patterns in the user’s LLM usage have become apparent. One is **requesting large, complex outputs in a single prompt** – for instance, asking the AI to “generate the entire authentication module code”. This often leads to issues: the AI might produce a lot of code that looks fine at first glance but doesn’t compile or doesn’t align perfectly with the spec (it could omit a subtle requirement like rate-limiting login attempts). It’s essentially skipping the step-by-step development process that a human would follow. Another anti-pattern is not providing the AI with sufficient scaffolding or context in certain cases – the flip side of the earlier positive pattern. There were times when the user asked the AI to write a function without first sharing the updated type definitions or the exact expected behavior, forcing the model to guess. Those guesses might be reasonable, but if they’re wrong, it results in throwaway code. For example, if the Session struct wasn’t defined in the prompt and the AI assumed a field that doesn’t exist, the output would be flawed. Lastly, relying on the AI to remember prior context far back in the conversation can be an anti-pattern if the session is long – details can get lost or the model may mix up concepts from earlier parts of the project. The user had to reset or reiterate context frequently, which suggests that breaking the work into smaller, focused sessions (an approach we’ll propose below) would be more effective.

In summary, the user’s use of LLMs has been *enthusiastic and generally beneficial* – the AI accelerated the writing of specs, offered code snippets, and likely helped brainstorm solutions. The patterns of feeding it references and focusing it on Rails-parity were smart. However, pain points like maintaining strict constraints and getting correct-by-construction code indicate there’s room to refine the collaboration strategy. By avoiding the anti-patterns (like one-shot large implementations) and seizing underused opportunities (like test-first prompting and thorough context provision), the user can significantly improve the outcome of AI assistance in the next phases of the project.

## Proposal: Improving LLM Collaboration with Design-First, Test-First Workflow

To make the most of AI assistance going forward, we recommend a more structured workflow that **front-loads function signatures, type definitions, and test scaffolding** before diving into implementation. This approach draws on software best practices (designing APIs first, writing tests early) and adapts them to an LLM collaboration context. The goal is to achieve more **compile-first success** – i.e. the code an AI suggests runs correctly on the first try – and to ensure the AI’s contributions are **architecturally correct** (aligned with our Rails-parity design) from the outset. Below is a step-by-step outline of this improved workflow, with practical examples relevant to the Campfire rewrite:

### 1\. Front-Load Function Signatures and Types

Begin by explicitly defining all key data types and function interfaces *before* asking the LLM to implement anything. Essentially, treat this as writing the module headers or trait definitions up front. For example, if we’re about to implement the messaging subsystem, we first specify in Rust code (or in a prompt to the AI) the exact signatures we plan to have:

* Data models: e.g. the Message struct with fields id: MessageId, room\_id: RoomId, user\_id: UserId, content: String, created\_at: DateTime\<Utc\>, client\_message\_id: Uuid. This should include every field necessary for Rails parity (like created\_at and perhaps updated\_at timestamps, which Rails would have). Likewise define Room (with fields like id, name, is\_closed, etc.) and User as needed, plus any enums. In our project, this was already outlined (e.g. **UserRole** enum with variants for member, admin, bot)[\[13\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=,simple%20error%20handling) – those definitions should be codified and shown to the AI. By doing this, we eliminate ambiguity; the AI doesn’t have to guess what a Message contains or what type RoomId is – it’s provided.

* Function signatures: e.g. for the **MessageService** (which encapsulates message logic), we list out async fn create\_message(\&self, content: \&str, room\_id: RoomId, user\_id: UserId, client\_message\_id: Uuid) \-\> Result\<Message, MessageError\>, async fn list\_messages(\&self, room\_id: RoomId, before: Option\<MessageId\>) \-\> Result\<Vec\<Message\>, MessageError\>, etc., *without bodies*. Each signature is accompanied by a brief comment of what it should do. This mirrors how one would design an interface or trait in a top-down approach. It’s essentially what our design document shows in prose and pseudocode, but here we make it concrete for the compiler and the AI. For instance, our design says we need a function to handle duplicate message IDs by returning the existing message[\[14\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20%231%3A%20client_message_id%20Deduplication%2A%2A%20,duplicate%20messages%20from%20rapid%20clicking) – so we’d ensure create\_message is specified to possibly return an existing message (hence Result\<Message, MessageError\> where MessageError could include an “Duplicate” variant or we simply treat it as non-error and return the existing Message).

Providing these signatures and type definitions to the LLM focuses its outputs. When it sees Result\<Message, MessageError\>, it will naturally structure the code to return a Message or a MessageError and use our Message struct fields. This reduces the chance of it introducing a different error type or ignoring a field. It also ensures **consistency**: if later we ask it to write, say, the rooms.rs handler for creating a room, it will use the same Room struct we defined, instead of conjuring a different notion of a Room. Essentially, by front-loading the types, we align the AI’s mental model with the project’s reality. This matches Rust’s philosophy of catching problems at compile time – here we’re catching design mismatches at “prompt time.” An additional benefit is that the user can compile these definitions (without implementations) to verify everything fits. This way, we know the signatures are sound and the AI’s job is just to fill in logic under these constraints.

*Practical Example:* The **Session management** component can benefit from this. Before implementing login/logout, define the Session struct and the functions in an AuthService interface. For instance: struct Session { token: String, user\_id: UserId, expires\_at: DateTime\<Utc\> } and a function async fn create\_session(\&self, user: \&User, password: \&str) \-\> Result\<Session, AuthError\>. By declaring this, we inform the AI that a session has an expiry and is linked to a user – so when coding, it won’t forget to set an expiration or to store the user relation. In our design, we know Rails stores sessions in DB with an expiry and secure token[\[31\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2A%2ADesign%20Approach%2A%2A%3A%20Rails,with%20secure%20cookies)[\[32\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Direct%20database%20insert%20sqlx%3A%3Aquery%21,await), so our signature reflects that. The AI seeing this signature might even recall or suggest, “Rails uses SecureRandom for tokens; we have a generate\_secure\_token() utility” – it stays on track with intended behavior.

### 2\. Establish Test Scaffolding Early (Unit, Integration, Property-Based)

Once the interfaces are set, use the LLM to help write **tests for the expected behavior** of each component *before* implementing them. This is essentially doing TDD with the AI as a partner. We already have a blueprint for many tests from the spec (the architecture L2 document includes examples of unit tests and integration tests). We should actually write those in code and expand on them with the AI’s assistance:

* **Unit Tests:** For each critical function or service, write focused tests that cover normal cases and edge cases. For example, for MessageService::create\_message, we can create a test (as shown in the spec) that creates a message, then attempts to create a duplicate and asserts that the second call returned the same message as the first[\[33\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=%2F%2F%20%E2%9C%85%20COMPLIANT%3A%20Test%20duplicate,db%2C%20broadcaster)[\[34\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Try%20to%20create%20duplicate,unwrap). We can ask the LLM to generate this test code using our types. The AI can produce the setup (maybe calling a helper to get a test database connection) and the assertions. We might need to guide it to use our actual API (like we have service.create\_message(...)), but once it knows the signature from step 1, it will use it correctly. Another unit test might be test\_create\_message\_success for the happy path[\[35\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=%2F%2F%20%E2%9C%85%20COMPLIANT%3A%20Simple%20unit,db%2C%20broadcaster)[\[36\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=let%20result%20%3D%20service.create_message%28%20,to_string%28%29%2C%20room_id%2C%20user_id%2C%20client_id%2C%20%29.await) which ensures a well-formed message is saved and returned. The LLM writing these tests ensures it fully understands what “success” means (e.g. the content echoes back, the IDs match).

* **Integration Tests:** These verify end-to-end behavior across the HTTP API and WebSockets. We can have the LLM draft a test where it simulates a client posting a new message via the HTTP endpoint and then reads it back (or receives it via WebSocket)[\[37\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=,await%3B%20let%20client%20%3D%20TestClient%3A%3Anew%28app)[\[38\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=%2F%2F%20%E2%9C%85%20COMPLIANT%3A%20WebSocket%20integration,await). The AI can utilize libraries like reqwest or Axum’s test utilities to do this. Such a test might: start the server (maybe with an in-memory SQLite for test), create a user and room, authenticate, then POST a message to /api/rooms/{id}/messages, then open a WebSocket to that room and ensure the message comes through. Writing this out is intricate but the AI can handle the boilerplate. Importantly, having this test means when we implement the underlying code, we know what it needs to achieve (e.g. broadcasting must be triggered on message creation for the WebSocket client to receive it, etc.). We effectively give the AI a target to meet.

* **Property-Based Tests:** Use the LLM to propose some property tests for non-trivial logic. For instance, presence tracking could have a property: no matter what sequence of joins/leaves (including out-of-order or duplicates), the number of online users reported is never negative and never exceeds the number of join events. Or for the message system, a property test could generate a sequence of random message sends (with random client IDs) and check that there are no duplicate client\_message\_id stored – i.e., if a duplicate is generated, the system should handle it gracefully and not increase the message count. We can prompt the AI with something like, “Using the proptest crate, write a test that inserts a series of messages with possibly duplicate client IDs and asserts that the number of unique messages in the DB is equal to the number of unique client IDs in the input.” The AI can draft this. This level of testing catches edge cases (like two identical UUIDs) that might be rare, but our system should handle by design (and it will, thanks to the DB constraint). Even if we don’t regularly run property tests, formulating them helps double-check our logic. It’s also an area the user hasn’t utilized much yet – by letting the AI suggest properties, we leverage its perspective to find corner cases.

By writing tests first, we effectively **lock in the expected behavior** in executable form. This has a dual benefit for LLM collaboration: (1) We can actually run these tests after implementation to know if the AI’s code is correct (fast feedback), and (2) we can show these tests to the AI when asking it to implement the code. The model will then craft the code to satisfy the tests. It’s akin to giving it a checklist of requirements in a very concrete way. Notably, our project’s documents explicitly advocate a TDD cycle[\[39\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=that%20accepts%20Rails,inspired%20simplicity)[\[40\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=Testing%20Strategy%3A%20TDD%20Implementation) – this step puts that into practice with the AI’s help, ensuring the model is on the same page about what “correct” means for each unit of functionality.

### 3\. Implement in Small Increments with the Tests as Guide

Now comes writing the implementation, and here we change the approach to be very incremental. Instead of, for example, prompting “Implement the entire MessageService,” we take it function by function, or even smaller if needed, using the test context as a guide:

* Pick one function (say create\_message) and remind the LLM of the relevant context: provide the signature (from step 1\) and the test(s) that target this function (from step 2). Then prompt: “Implement this function so that all the above tests pass.” This is a powerful prompt because it clearly defines “done” (tests passing) and gives the AI specific boundaries. For create\_message, the AI will know from the test that a duplicate insert should return the existing message instead of a new one[\[41\]](file://file-R7fMD1SghK9632axkr6vXk#:~:text=let%20second%20%3D%20service.create_message%28%20,unwrap). It will likely produce code that: inserts the message via sqlx, detects a UNIQUE constraint error (perhaps via a SQLSTATE or error message), then queries for the existing message and returns it. This aligns perfectly with the intended behavior (and mirrors what Rails would do using find\_or\_create\_by semantics). Because we also provided the type definitions, the AI will use the correct field names in the SQL query and the right error type (MessageError) in the Result. The chances of a first-try compile go way up. (In fact, using sqlx::query\! would even enforce at compile time that our SQL is correct against the schema – the AI, seeing our earlier design choice of compile-time SQL checks[\[42\]](file://file-Aogj9BqxNhnUTHB4oaLffm#:~:text=%2A%2AKey%20Design%20Decisions%2A%2A%3A%20,Task%20pattern%20for%20write%20serialization), might even use that macro, which would be ideal.)

* Continue this process for each function. For example, next could be list\_messages (with tests for pagination or limits), then perhaps the WebSocket broadcast function. In each case, by focusing the AI on one task and showing tests, we reduce the cognitive load and keep the solution on target. This incremental approach prevents the AI from mixing up logic between functions or introducing unintended side effects that span across components, because we’re not asking it to consider too many things at once.

* It’s important to compile and run tests after each small implementation. Given the front-loaded info, we expect minimal compile errors. If one does arise (say the AI called a method with wrong parameters), it’s easier to correct in a small context and even re-run the AI on that single issue. Contrast this with a scenario where it wrote 1000 lines and we have 50 compiler errors – much harder to untangle. By keeping the increments small, we catch mistakes quickly. Moreover, when the test passes, we gain confidence that this piece meets the spec before moving on.

This step essentially turns the LLM into a highly focused coder that writes just enough code to satisfy the known requirements (the tests), no more and no less. It tends to prevent the AI from **over-engineering**. For instance, if there were no test for a certain edge case, the AI might ignore it – which is acceptable if that edge case truly isn’t required. Conversely, if the test enforces a behavior (like “broadcast function should not fail even if one socket is closed; just log and continue”), the AI will implement exactly that (e.g. wrap sends in a match and log errors, as our spec expects[\[43\]](file://file-AP1y7LFXMfAXfshxeyPzHp#:~:text=for%20connection%20in%20connections%20,)). The result is code that is minimal and purpose-fit, much like a human doing TDD would produce.

### 4\. Iterate and Use LLM for Refinement and Review

After implementing each piece, we should not simply move on – it’s valuable to have the LLM reflect on the code in the context of the broader architecture. This is an often underused aspect: LLMs can analyze code too, not just write it. We can prompt the AI with something like: “Here is the implemented function create\_message (show code). Does this adhere to our architecture guidelines and Rails parity?” Since the model has been involved in the entire process, it can cross-check the code against the earlier design decisions. It might catch something subtle. For example, it could respond with: “The implementation looks correct and passes tests. Note that Rails’ Campfire would also trigger a notification in some cases – is that handled here or deferred?” This could remind us to ensure that maybe our MessageService.create\_message should call the NotificationService to send a push notification if the user has one (which might be a to-do for later, but good to note). Essentially, the AI can serve as a second set of eyes to ensure we didn’t violate any of the **anti-coordination rules** or skip a requirement. Since our documents list **checklists** (e.g. “no more than 3 async operations per request”[\[44\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%F0%9F%93%8F%20COMPLEXITY%20LIMITS%20,Single%20database%20connection%20pool)), we could even ask the AI to evaluate compliance: “Does this function use direct calls and at most 3 awaits?” It can quickly say, “Yes, it uses one DB call and one broadcast await, which is within limits.” This kind of review uses the LLM’s understanding in a QA role.

Additionally, we can have the AI generate **additional test cases** after seeing the implementation, as a way to verify robustness. For instance, after implementing presence tracking, ask: “Can you think of edge cases for the presence system and write tests for them?” The AI might suggest a test where a user opens two connections and closes one – ensuring the user is still shown online (count \= 1), which we might not have explicitly tested yet. We then run that test to see if our code holds up. If not, we fix and loop again.

**Why this workflow improves compile-first success and architectural correctness:** By the time we ask the LLM to generate any significant chunk of code, we have constrained the problem space considerably. The function signatures act like a contract – the AI must return the right types and use the given inputs (if it doesn’t, the compiler will complain, and our prompt context being the source-of-truth types ensures it usually does). The exhaustive type definitions mean fewer chances for name mismatches or incorrect assumptions. The test scaffolding provides a behavioral contract – the AI aims for code that passes the tests, which typically means it aligns with the requirements (since our tests are derived from requirements). This process mirrors **design by contract** and TDD, both of which are known to reduce bugs. We’re effectively coding with the AI in a way that’s *preventative* of errors rather than *reactive* to them. In contrast, earlier the user sometimes let the AI code more freely and then had to debug; now we’re setting things up so that the AI’s first attempt is guided to be correct.

Moreover, this workflow enforces that the AI’s contributions fit the intended architecture. Because we’re implementing piecewise and always considering the spec/tests, there’s little room for an off-the-rails creative solution that doesn’t match Rails parity. For example, if at some point the AI had a fancy idea to use a global cache for messages (which might break our no-global-state rule), writing tests first (which likely operate via public APIs) would not necessitate any global cache – so the AI wouldn’t introduce it just to pass the tests. It will stick to the simplest thing that works, which is exactly what we want (and what Rails does). This aligns with the **“simple beats clever”** mantra in our requirements[\[45\]](file://file-YXGxUttdYuMpzvruj9tE3x#:~:text=%F0%9F%8E%AF%20%2A%2ARAILS%20PARITY%20RULE%2A%2A%20,obvious%20solutions%20over%20optimized%20ones).

**Illustrative Example – Bringing it Together:** Consider **Critical Gap \#3: SQLite write serialization** – Rails effectively serializes writes via its single-threaded ActiveRecord \+ connection pool behavior, and our plan was to use a single writer task with an mpsc channel[\[15\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=%2A%2AGap%20,handle%20concurrent%20updates%20properly)[\[46\]](file://file-DEkqfnxJM2FhcGTRtzYc18#:~:text=2,Serialization). Here’s how the improved workflow would play out for implementing this:

* We define the interface: perhaps a DatabaseWriter struct with async fn submit\_write(\&self, WriteOperation) \-\> Result\<(), DbError\> and an internal loop that we’ll spawn to process that channel. We also define the enum WriteOperation (could be variants like InsertMessage(NewMessage), UpdateRoom(...), etc. depending on needs). No logic yet, just the type and signature.

* We write tests. One test could simulate two writes coming in “concurrently” (maybe by spawning two async tasks that call submit\_write and then checking the order or final state). Another test might ensure that if the writer task is stopped or an error occurs, it’s handled gracefully (this might be more of an integration test with a shutdown). We can also test that read operations are not blocked by writes (if that’s part of the requirement). These tests clarify what the writer is supposed to guarantee.

* Then we implement in small steps. Maybe first implement the basic channel: create the channel, implement submit\_write to send on it, spawn a background task that reads from the channel and executes the DB operations in order. We ask the AI to do just that much, referencing the tests that, say, insert two messages and expect them both to be committed. The AI writes the code to loop over the channel and apply each WriteOperation by calling the appropriate database function. Because it knows from tests that two inserts should both succeed sequentially, it will naturally not introduce any locking beyond that single task (staying within our single-thread model). We compile and run tests, adjust if needed.

* We then refine: maybe add a mechanism for graceful shutdown of the writer (if the app is stopping). That can be another small addition with its own test (“when dropping DatabaseWriter, it drains remaining operations”).

At each stage, the AI is working within a well-defined frame. The output is more likely to be correct and minimal. The final result is an implementation of the write-serialization gap that is robust, and we got there with the AI’s help but without the typical back-and-forth of “AI proposes – dev debugs – AI fixes”, because we set it up right initially.

### 5\. Documentation and Future Collaboration

As a closing note, this front-loaded approach also leaves us with up-to-date documentation in the code (the function signatures and comments, and the tests which serve as examples). This makes continuing collaboration with the LLM easier: any new developer or AI instance can read the code/tests to quickly grasp the system. We should continue using the AI to document anything that isn’t clear from context (though in this project, the extensive markdown docs cover a lot). For future features (say, enabling file attachments in v2.0), we can apply the same workflow: define what the file service interface looks like, write tests (maybe using dummy files or ensuring the UI shows “coming soon”), then implement incrementally. The LLM will slot into this process, providing code that is likely correct by design.

By adopting this improved workflow, the **LLM becomes a powerful ally in exactly the way we need**: it will churn out boilerplate and straightforward code rapidly (once we’ve done the thinking on types and tests), and it will do so with fewer mistakes. This lets the human developers spend more energy on the hard decisions (which we feed into the AI) and less on tedious debugging. In effect, we align the LLM’s strengths (speed, knowledge of common patterns) with the project’s requirements (accuracy, simplicity, parity with Rails). The expected outcome is a faster development cycle with far less friction – code that *just works* and adheres to our architecture, allowing the team to meet the ambitious goal of reimplementing Campfire in Rust with confidence.
