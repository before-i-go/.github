# Rust OSS Concepts

## Scope Guidelines
This file contains insights and concepts related to:
- Rust programming language idioms, patterns, and best practices
- Open source software development strategies and methodologies
- Implementation examples, code snippets, function signatures, and struct definitions
- CLI workflows, developer experience, and tooling approaches
- Storage architectures, persistence strategies, and caching mechanisms
- Technical architecture, performance optimization, and algorithmic approaches
- MVP-relevant technical concepts for Rust-based projects

## Content Organization
Insights are organized using the Minto Pyramid Principle with the following structure:

### Master Summary Table
| CONCLUSION | KEY LINE | LOGIC FLOW | CATEGORY | PRIORITY | SOURCE |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|--------|

### Category Definitions
- **Architecture**: System design, patterns, structure
- **Performance**: Speed, optimization, benchmarks
- **Safety**: Memory safety, error handling, security
- **Tooling**: Build systems, CI/CD, development tools
- **Community**: OSS strategy, collaboration, governance
- **Implementation**: Code patterns, idioms, examples

## Routing Rules
Content should be routed to this file if it relates to:
- Rust-specific development patterns and practices
- Open source project architecture and design
- Implementation details and code examples
- Developer tools and CLI workflows
- Storage systems and performance optimization
- Technical architecture decisions

## Quality Standards
- **High Priority (9-10)**: Revolutionary insights, first-of-its-kind approaches
- **Medium Priority (5-8)**: Valuable improvements, innovative applications
- **Low Priority (1-4)**: Supporting details, reference material

All insights must pass the "ultrathink" test:
- Why is this insight significant beyond surface level?
- How does this connect to other insights across documents?
- What deeper pattern or principle is being revealed?
- Is this truly unique or just repackaged common knowledge?
- What would make this insight actionable and valuable?
