- **Low Priority (1-4)**: Foundational concepts, reference material

All insights must pass the "ultrathink" test:
- Why is this insight significant beyond surface level?
- How does this connect to other insights across documents?
- What deeper pattern or principle is being revealed?
- Is this truly unique or just repackaged common knowledge?
- What would make this insight actionable and valuable?
