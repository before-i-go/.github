# Warp.dev Coding Best Practices

*Last Updated: September 18, 2025*

## Overview

Warp represents a paradigm shift in terminal-based development, combining AI agents with modern terminal capabilities to create agentic workflows for understanding codebases, writing code, and debugging. This guide outlines best practices for maximizing productivity when coding with Warp.dev.

## Core Philosophy

Warp enables **agentic workflows** - AI-driven processes that can:
- Understand your codebase contextually
- Generate and edit code directly within the terminal
- Debug issues across the full development lifecycle
- Work with any CLI tool to bring agent support to version control, CI/CD, and deployment workflows

## Essential Setup and Configuration

### 1. Codebase Indexing
```bash
# Warp automatically indexes Git-tracked codebases
# Ensure your project is under version control
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Check indexing status in Settings > Code > Codebase Index
```

### 2. Optimize Indexing with .warpindexingignore
```bash
# Create .warpindexingignore for large codebases
echo "node_modules/
target/
*.log
.git/
build/
dist/" > .warpindexingignore
```

### 3. Project-Specific Rules (WARP.md)
Create a `WARP.md` file in your project root with:
- Project architecture overview
- Common development commands
- Coding standards and conventions
- Build, test, and deployment procedures

## Agent Mode Best Practices

### Context Management

**1. Use @ Symbol for File References**
```bash
# Reference specific files or code sections
@src/main.rs explain this function

# Reference multiple files
@src/lib.rs @tests/integration.rs compare these implementations
```

**2. Attach Terminal Output as Context**
```bash
# Run commands and use output as context
cargo build 2>&1 | tee build_output.txt
# Then reference the build errors in your next prompt
```

**3. Leverage Images for Visual Context**
- Screenshot error messages, diagrams, or UI mockups
- Drag and drop images directly into Warp for context

### Effective Prompting Strategies

**1. Be Specific with Code Generation Requests**
```bash
# Good: Specific and actionable
"Write a Rust function that parses JSON into a struct with error handling using serde"

# Better: Include context and constraints
"Write a Rust function that parses user configuration JSON into a Config struct, 
handles missing fields with defaults, and returns Result<Config, ConfigError>"
```

**2. Leverage Multi-file Operations**
```bash
# Request batch changes across multiple files
"Add headers with MIT license to all .rs files in src/"
"Update all instances of 'DatabaseConnection' to 'DbConn' across the codebase"
```

**3. Use Error-Driven Development**
```bash
# When you encounter errors, paste them directly
"Fix this TypeScript error: Property 'userName' does not exist on type 'User'"
```

### Code Generation Best Practices

**1. Start with High-Level Architecture**
```bash
# Request architectural guidance first
"Design the module structure for a Rust web API with authentication, 
database layer, and REST endpoints"
```

**2. Iterate with Refinements**
```bash
# Initial request
"Create a basic HTTP server in Rust using axum"

# Follow-up refinements
"Add middleware for logging and CORS to the previous server"
"Add error handling with custom error types"
```

**3. Request Tests Alongside Code**
```bash
"Write a User authentication service in Rust with comprehensive unit tests"
"Generate integration tests for the API endpoints we just created"
```

## Advanced Workflows

### 1. Full Development Lifecycle Integration

**Planning Phase:**
```bash
# Use Warp for project planning
"Analyze the requirements and suggest a technical architecture for [project description]"
```

**Development Phase:**
```bash
# Code generation with context
"Based on our existing database schema, generate CRUD operations for the User model"

# Refactoring assistance
"Refactor this monolithic function into smaller, more testable components"
```

**Testing Phase:**
```bash
# Test generation and improvement
"Generate comprehensive tests for this error handling logic"
"Improve test coverage by identifying untested edge cases"
```

**Debugging Phase:**
```bash
# Error analysis
"This test is failing with [error message]. Debug and fix the issue"

# Log analysis
"Summarize these application logs and identify potential performance bottlenecks"
```

**Deployment Phase:**
```bash
# Infrastructure as code
"Generate GitHub Actions workflow for Rust project with testing and deployment"
"Create Docker configuration for this Rust web service"
```

### 2. Maintenance and Optimization

**Code Reviews:**
```bash
"Review this pull request diff and suggest improvements focusing on performance and maintainability"
```

**Performance Analysis:**
```bash
"Analyze this Rust code for potential performance optimizations"
"Generate SQL queries to debug these N+1 query issues"
```

**Documentation:**
```bash
"Generate comprehensive API documentation for these Rust modules"
"Create README.md with setup instructions for this project"
```

## Language-Specific Best Practices

### Rust Development with Warp

- Use specific line ranges when referencing large files
- Combine related requests to minimize context switching

### 2. Leverage Warp Drive Integration
- Store frequently used prompts in Warp Drive
- Create reusable workflows for common tasks
- Use environment variables for project-specific configurations

### 3. Batch Operations
```bash
# Efficient batch processing
"Apply consistent formatting to all files in src/ directory"
"Update import statements across the entire codebase"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Context Limitations
**Issue:** Agent seems to miss important context
**Solution:** 
- Use @file references more specifically
- Break down complex requests into smaller, focused prompts
- Provide more explicit context about project structure

### 2. Code Quality Issues
**Issue:** Generated code doesn't follow project conventions
**Solution:**
- Maintain detailed WARP.md with coding standards
- Reference existing code patterns explicitly
- Request code reviews and iterative improvements

### 3. Performance Concerns
**Issue:** Large codebase operations are slow
**Solution:**
- Use .warpindexingignore effectively
- Focus on specific modules or directories
- Break down large operations into smaller chunks

## Security Considerations

### 1. Sensitive Information
- Never include API keys, tokens, or passwords in prompts
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Regularly review generated code for hardcoded sensitive data

### 2. Code Quality Assurance
```bash
"Audit this code for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements"
"Check for potential SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities"
```

## Best Practices Summary
