# SOPv1: Systematic Discovery of High-PMF, Easy-to-Test Rust Libraries

**VERSION**: 1.0 - Initial methodology established through ResearchLot01 experience
**EVOLUTION**: This SOP will evolve (SOPv2, SOPv3, etc.) as we refine the methodology through successive research lots

## ESSENCE: Systematic Discovery of High-PMF, Easy-to-Test Rust Libraries

**CORE MISSION**: Transform raw content into prioritized Rust library concepts through systematic analysis, targeting libraries with 8-10/10 scores in Testing Ease, PMF Probability, and Differentiation Potential.

**SUCCESS OUTCOME**: Ranked list of Rust library concepts that developers actively seek, use, and contribute to - creating sustainable open source projects with real-world impact.

## LAYER 1: Execution Framework

### Three-Phase Process
1. **ORGANIZE**: Structure content for systematic analysis (✅ COMPLETE)
2. **ANALYZE**: Extract use cases through 1000-line chunk methodology 
3. **SYNTHESIZE**: Rank and prioritize discovered library concepts

### Repository Structure (Scalable Research Lot System)
- **SOP/**: Methodology documentation + monitoring tools (repo-level)
- **ResearchLot01/** (Current State: ✅ ORGANIZED + DEDUPLICATED)
  - **TxtInput01/**: 111 unique .txt files ready for analysis (duplicates removed)
  - **NonTxtInput01/**: 173 original files preserved as backup
  - **Progress01/**: Analysis tracking (use-case-analysis.md)
  - **Output01/**: Results compilation (use-case-202509.md)
  - **Duplicates01/**: 32 duplicate files moved here (shortest names kept in TxtInput01)
- **ResearchLot02/**, **ResearchLot03/**, etc. (Future research batches using same methodology)

## LAYER 2: Analysis Methodology

### Core Analysis Rule
**DO NOT TOUCH REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT UNTIL USE CASE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE** - Ensures comprehensive understanding before finalizing requirements.

### Systematic Extraction Process
1. **Duplicate Detection**: Run MD5 hash check, keep shortest filenames, move duplicates to ResearchLot##/Duplicates##/
2. **Chunk Processing**: Break ResearchLot##/TxtInput##/ files into 1000-line segments (read 250-500 lines due to token limits)
3. **Relevance Filtering**: Mark irrelevant content (medical, entertainment, non-technical)
4. **Use Case Extraction**: Score each concept on three dimensions (1-10 scale)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Update ResearchLot##/Progress##/use-case-analysis.md after each chunk
6. **Results Compilation**: Append findings to ResearchLot##/Output##/use-case-YYYYMM.md

## LAYER 3: Scoring Framework

### Three-Dimensional Evaluation (1-10 scale)

#### PMF Probability (Product-Market Fit)
- **9-10**: Critical widespread pain points, developers actively searching
- **7-8**: Common problems with clear market demand
- **5-6**: Nice-to-have solutions for niche audiences
- **1-4**: Limited market need or novelty

#### Ease of Testing
- **9-10**: Deterministic behavior, clear I/O, comprehensive test coverage possible
- **7-8**: Testable with setup, manageable complexity
- **5-6**: Testing possible but complex/integration-heavy
- **1-4**: Difficult to test reliably, non-deterministic

#### Differentiation Potential
- **9-10**: Truly innovative, no direct competitors, 10x improvement
- **7-8**: Clear advantages, unique features/approaches
- **5-6**: Incremental improvements over existing solutions
- **1-4**: Me-too products, crowded space

### Content Relevance Filter

#### ANALYZE (Programming-focused content)
Systems programming, developer tools, performance optimization, runtime analysis, web architectures, databases, security tools, build systems, memory safety, concurrency, cross-language integration

#### SKIP (Non-programming content)
Medical/health, entertainment, non-technical research, personal development

## LAYER 4: Execution Details

### Progress Tracking Protocol
- Update ResearchLot##/Progress##/use-case-analysis.md after each 1000-line chunk
- Maintain accurate chunk completion counts  
- Calculate and display overall progress percentage
- Use `./SOP/tree-with-wc.sh` for repository monitoring

### Completion Criteria (ALL must be satisfied)
1. ALL checklists in ResearchLot##/Progress##/use-case-analysis.md marked complete
2. Comprehensive use case list compiled in ResearchLot##/Output##/use-case-YYYYMM.md
3. Use cases ranked and categorized by scores

### Execution Mindset
**CONTINUOUS FOCUS**: Treat as uninterrupted analysis session. Each 1000-line chunk advances toward comprehensive use case identification. Maintain momentum through all files systematically.

**COMPLETION GATE**: DO NOT STOP until ALL checklists completed. Only then pause for requirements synthesis.

### Sample Analysis Pattern (5 lines)
```
#### filename.txt (X lines - Content Type)
- [ ] Lines 1-1000: Brief description of content found
- [ ] Lines 1001-2000: Brief description of content found  
- [ ] Lines 2001-3000: Brief description of content found
- [ ] Lines 3001-4000: Brief description of content found
```

### Duplicate Detection Pattern (ResearchLot01: ✅ COMPLETE)
```bash
# 1. Generate MD5 hashes for all files
find ResearchLot##/TxtInput##/ -type f -exec md5sum {} \; | sort > /tmp/all_hashes.txt

# 2. Identify duplicate hashes
awk '{print $1}' /tmp/all_hashes.txt | uniq -d > /tmp/duplicate_hashes.txt

# 3. For each duplicate hash, keep shortest filename, move others to Duplicates##/
while read hash; do
    grep "^$hash" /tmp/all_hashes.txt | while IFS=' ' read -r h file; do
        echo ${#file} "$file"
    done | sort -n | while read len file; do
        echo "$file"
    done > /tmp/files_for_hash.txt
    
    first_file=$(head -n1 /tmp/files_for_hash.txt)
    tail -n +2 /tmp/files_for_hash.txt | while IFS= read -r file; do
        if [ -f "$file" ]; then
            mv "$file" "ResearchLot##/Duplicates##/"
        fi
    done
done < /tmp/duplicate_hashes.txt
```
## SOPv1 Development: ResearchLot01 Organization Complete ✅

### Methodology Genesis
This SOPv1 was developed through hands-on experience organizing ResearchLot01. Key insights that shaped this methodology:

#### 1. **Repository Structure Reorganization**
- Created clean folder structure: NonTxtInput01/, TxtInput01/, SOP/, Progress01/, Output01/
- Moved all non-text files (docx, xlsx, pdf, html, binary json) to NonTxtInput01/ for preservation
- Established TxtInput01/ as the single source of truth for analysis-ready content

#### 2. **File Format Standardization** 
- Converted all analyzable content to consistent .txt format with clear naming convention:
  - `filename_from_md.txt` (from markdown files)
  - `filename_from_json.txt` (from JSON files) 
  - `filename_from_docx.txt` (from Word documents)
  - `filename_from_html.txt` (from HTML files)
  - `filename_from_pdf.txt` (from PDF files)

#### 3. **Content Conversion & Preservation**
- Successfully converted 131 files to .txt format in TxtInput01/
- Preserved all 173 original files in NonTxtInput01/ as backup
- Fixed tree-with-wc.sh script to properly detect text files (JSON data, empty files)

#### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- Resolved "binary file" misclassification issue in reporting
- Verified all content is properly accessible and readable
- Ensured comprehensive coverage of all source materials

### Current Repository Status

#### Final Organization ✅
- **ResearchLot01/NonTxtInput01/**: 173 files (all originals preserved: docx, xlsx, pdf, html, json, md)
- **ResearchLot01/TxtInput01/**: 111 unique .txt files ONLY - ready for systematic analysis
- **ResearchLot01/Duplicates01/**: 32 duplicate files moved here (shortest names kept)
- **ResearchLot01/Progress01/**: 1 file (use-case-analysis.md tracking progress)
- **ResearchLot01/Output01/**: 2 files (use-case-202509.md + summary)
- **SOP/**: 2 files (steering document + corrected tree script)

#### Content Statistics
- **Total Files**: 304 files organized
- **Analysis-Ready**: 111 unique .txt files with millions of words of content (32 duplicates removed)
- **Preserved Originals**: 173 files safely archived
- **Duplicates Archived**: 32 files moved to Duplicates01/ (shortest names kept for analysis)
- **Major Content Sources**: React patterns, WASM/Rust performance, programming languages, runtime systems, Zig patterns, OS development, Rust library ideas

### Ready for Systematic Analysis
The repository is now perfectly organized for the systematic 1000-line chunk analysis methodology. All content is:
- ✅ Consistently formatted as .txt files
- ✅ Properly named and categorized  
- ✅ Fully accessible for analysis
- ✅ Backed up with originals preserved

### SOPv1 Evolution Path
- **Current**: SOPv1 established through ResearchLot01 organization experience
- **Future**: SOPv2 will incorporate lessons learned from ResearchLot01 analysis phase
- **Continuous**: Each ResearchLot will contribute to methodology refinement

**Next Step**: Apply SOPv1 methodology to ResearchLot01 systematic analysis, capturing lessons for SOPv2.
