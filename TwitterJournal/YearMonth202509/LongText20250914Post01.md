# Understanding challenges of math for school kids in India

``` text
My research in short:

*The dislike or discomfort with maths compounds from being unable to multiply at a young age ➡️ or understand fractions  ➡️ I am not good at it ➡️ Word problems are scare ➡️  I am not good at it ➡️ I dislike it ➡️ Dislike, Discomfort Compounds on easier concepts also ➡️ Calculus and so on *

This is further fueled by the marking scheme in mathematics which is not at par with rest of the rote subjects where you can score much higher. Maths medium score folks do far better in later years because they intend on understanding rather than scoring marks

This is my hypothesis, I could be wrong, feel free to share your opinion

### TIL Github does not index your repo unless you search at least once

The image shows a modal stating:

> that-in-rust/campfire-on-rust is not indexed yet  
> This repository can't be accessed by ChatGPT until it's indexed by GitHub. You can trigger indexing by searching the repository's code on GitHub. After about 5–10 minutes, you can use it in ChatGPT.  
> [Trigger indexing on GitHub]

**What this means:**  
GitHub repositories must be indexed for features like ChatGPT code search or Copilot Chat to work. If a repo isn't indexed, ChatGPT can't access its code.

**How to trigger indexing:**  
1. **Click "Trigger indexing on GitHub"**  
   - This button usually opens the repository's code search page on GitHub.
   - Alternatively, you can manually go to the repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/that-in-rust/campfire-on-rust).

2. **Search the Repository's Code**  
   - Use the search bar at the top of the repository page.
   - Type any search term (even just a letter like a or *) and hit Enter.
   - This action prompts GitHub to index the repository for code search and for tools like Copilot and ChatGPT.

3. **Wait 5–10 Minutes**  
   - Indexing usually completes within a few minutes.
   - After that, you should be able to access the repository in ChatGPT and other GitHub-integrated tools.

**Summary:**  
- Go to the repo on GitHub.
- Use the code search function there.
- Wait a few minutes for indexing to complete.
