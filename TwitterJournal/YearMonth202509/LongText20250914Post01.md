# Understanding challenges of math for school kids in India

``` text
My research in short:

*The dislike or discomfort with maths compounds from being unable to multiply at a young age ➡️ or understand fractions  ➡️ I am not good at it ➡️ Word problems are scare ➡️  I am not good at it ➡️ I dislike it ➡️ Dislike, Discomfort Compounds on easier concepts also ➡️ Calculus and so on *

This is further fueled by the marking scheme in mathematics which is not at par with rest of the rote subjects where you can score much higher. Maths medium score folks do far better in later years because they intend on understanding rather than scoring marks

This is my hypothesis, I could be wrong, feel free to share your opinion
