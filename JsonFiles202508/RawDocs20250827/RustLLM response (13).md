# CPU and Algorithm Optimization Blueprint for RustHallows

## Phase 0 - Meta-Cognitive Tuning & Task Analysis
Premise is sound. Proceeding with optimized protocol focused exclusively on CPU, algorithms, and precedence systems.

## Phase 1 - Cognitive Staging & Resource Allocation

**Expert Council:**
- Systems Scheduler Architect (ex-Linux CFS maintainer)
- Cache Optimization Specialist (ex-Intel)
- Concurrent Algorithms Researcher (ex-Microsoft Research)
- Rust Compiler Optimization Lead (ex-Mozilla)
- Skeptical Engineer (ex-Facebook Performance Team)

**Knowledge Scaffolding:**
- CPU microarchitecture (pipeline stages, branch prediction, cache hierarchy)
- Modern scheduler algorithms (CFS, BFS, EDF)
- Memory access patterns (spatial/temporal locality)
- Lock-free data structures and synchronization primitives
- Rust's LLVM backend optimization paths
- Thread-per-core models, work-stealing algorithms

## Phase 2 - Multi-Perspective Exploration

**Conventional Approach:**
Rust userspace applications on Linux with tweaked kernel parameters, profile-guided optimization, and custom allocators.

**Conceptual Blends:**
1. **Cellular Automata × Scheduler:** "Cellular Scheduler" - CPU cores as cells with state transitions based on neighbor load; scheduling decisions spread like cellular patterns across cores.
2. **Distributed Systems × Cache Management:** Cache lines treated as distributed consensus nodes with leader election and quorum reads/writes.
3. **Railway Engineering × Instruction Pipeline:** "Track Switching" - instruction streams follow signaled tracks with pre-computed branch switching and junction points.

**Selected Approach:** 
Cellular Scheduler blend with Railway Engineering concepts - enables localized scheduling decisions with global emergent behavior while maximizing instruction throughput.

## Structured Debate

**Scheduler Architect:** We should implement per-core schedulers with local runqueues and cellular communication patterns between neighboring cores.

**Cache Specialist:** Each core should maintain ownership of specific cache lines, with explicit cache-aware data layouts and prefetch hints encoded in the scheduler.

**Algorithms Researcher:** Priority should be on zero-pause lock-free algorithms with bounded interference; implement flat combining for contended resources.

**Compiler Optimization Lead:** We need LLVM IR pass customization to recognize our synchronization patterns and generate optimal machine code.

**Skeptical Engineer:** What about scheduler thrashing during high contention? Will work-stealing cause cache pollution? How do we handle NUMA boundaries?

**Rebuttals:**
- **Scheduler Architect:** Core-local scheduling avoids thrashing; cellular load balancing uses hysteresis to prevent oscillation.
- **Cache Specialist:** NUMA-aware cache directories with explicit migration costs in the scheduler model.
- **Compiler Lead:** Custom Rust intrinsics can leverage CPU-specific instructions for inter-core signaling.

**Synthesized Thesis:**
RustHallows should implement a cellular automata-based scheduler with locality-aware work distribution, zero-copy inter-core communication, and railway-inspired instruction pipelining optimizations, all expressed in Rust with custom LLVM passes.

## Phase 3 - Draft & Verification

### Core Components

1. **CellularCore Scheduler**
   - Per-core autonomous schedulers with 3-state cellular automaton (hungry/balanced/saturated)
   - Neighboring cores exchange load information via L1-L2 cache coherence messages
   - Dynamic task affinity adjustment based on cache footprint profiling

2. **RailwayDispatch Pipeline**
   - Pre-computed branch paths with instruction grouping optimized for CPU frontend
   - Explicit memory dependency graphs to maximize memory-level parallelism
   - Cache-line ownership registry to minimize false sharing

3. **Lock-Free Primitives Library**
   - Hazard pointer implementation optimized for Rust's lifetime system
   - Bounded MPSC queues with cache-aligned slots
   - Epoch-based reclamation with adaptive epoch advancement

4. **Rust Compiler Extensions**
   - Custom LLVM passes for branch layout optimization
   - Memory access pattern analysis for automatic prefetching
   - Function multiversioning based on contention patterns
