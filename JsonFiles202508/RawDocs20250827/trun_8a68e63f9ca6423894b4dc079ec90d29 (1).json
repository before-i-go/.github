This phase is defined by the launch of his YouTube channel in April 2023, which became his primary medium for frequent, in-depth content. While he continues to build on his foundational themes, his focus has broadened significantly. Prominent new themes include the impact of AI on product management, detailed strategies for career development and personal growth (e.g., 'Your Career Is Your Most Important Product'), deeper dives into organizational dynamics and execution, and explorations into broader life philosophy, including conversations with figures like Dr. Kapil Gupta.

To aid discovery, his most important threads are often cataloged on the Thread Reader App (threadreaderapp.com/user/shreyas), which provides unrolled, readable versions. Furthermore, he maintains a 'secret subscribers-only content' index on Coda, which organizes approximately 900 pieces of his content, primarily from Twitter. He has also self-curated key threads, such as his 'A thread of my most popular threads' (September 8, 2020), which serves as a curriculum covering foundational topics like 'High Agency', the 'Preventable Problem Paradox', PM leadership, and cognitive biases. His pinned tweet on 'High Agency' (June 27, 2020) is one of his most well-known works.",

His profile serves as the canonical source for many of the articles listed on his personal website. His articles cover a wide range of topics in product management, leadership, and strategy.

He also uses the platform for shorter, high-signal posts on topics such as the LNO framework, PM performance evaluation, dealing with unsolicited feedback, and the impact of AI on the product role.

    "platform_overview_podcasts": {
      "summary_of_appearances": "Shreyas Doshi is a frequent and sought-after guest on many of the industry's leading podcasts focused on technology, business, and product development. In these long-form conversations, he elaborates on the frameworks and concepts he introduces in his writing, providing deeper context, real-world examples from his career at Stripe, Google, and Twitter, and answers to host questions.

      "common_topics": "During his podcast interviews, Shreyas Doshi consistently discusses a core set of topics. These include his signature frameworks like the LNO framework for prioritization and the concept of 'High Agency'. He frequently delves into the three levels of product work (impact, execution, optics), the distinction between measurement and evaluation, the importance of pre-mortems, the pitfalls of ROI-based thinking versus opportunity cost, and practical advice for career growth, decision-making, and navigating organizational challenges."

Another notable deck is 'My Journey and Product Management Lessons Learned', a 49-slide presentation reflecting on his 15-year career and key lessons, including the importance of 'high agency'. An older presentation from 2010, 'How To Get That Next Pm Job', provides tactical advice for job seekers. These presentations offer a condensed and highly structured format for learning his frameworks.",
    "data_collection_methodology": {
      "identity_disambiguation": "To ensure all collected content was authored by the correct Shreyas Doshi, a strict identity verification process was implemented. The primary method involved cross-referencing content with a set of canonical sources and biographical details. This included his official website (shreyasdoshi.com), which links to his other verified profiles, and his professional bio, which consistently identifies him as a Product Leader with past employment at Stripe, Twitter, Google, and Yahoo. Content was verified against his known social media handles, including Twitter/X (@shreyas), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/shreyasdoshi), Medium (@shreyashere), and YouTube (@ShreyasDoshiVideos). This process was crucial for distinguishing him from known namesakes, such as Shreyas R. Doshi of GitHub. Any content that could not be confidently attributed through these verification methods was excluded.",
      "search_strategy": "A comprehensive search strategy was employed to locate Shreyas Doshi's content across a wide range of platforms, including those less obvious than his primary social media accounts. The strategy utilized a combination of advanced search query techniques. Site-specific searches (e.g., `site:fs.blog \"Shreyas Doshi\"`) were used to probe known host domains like podcast websites and blogs. Filetype searches (e.g., `\"Shreyas Doshi\" filetype:pdf`) were used to uncover standalone documents and presentations, such as those on SlideShare. Exact-phrase searches were used to find specific titles or attributions (e.g., `\"by Shreyas Doshi\"`). These were combined with keywords related to his expertise and employment history (`product management`, `leadership`, `Stripe`, `Google`). Furthermore, archival services, particularly the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine and its CDX Server API, were systematically queried to find and recover content, including pages that are no longer live.",
      "canonicalization_summary": "To create a single, authoritative record for each piece of work, a hierarchical canonicalization policy was established, based on industry best practices for search engine optimization. The strongest signal for identifying the primary source was the presence of a `rel=\"canonical\"` HTML tag, which explicitly declares the preferred URL. In the absence of this tag, the content instance with the earliest known publication date was prioritized, especially if it was hosted on his personal website, shreyasdoshi.com. For platform-native content like videos or tweets, the platform of origin (e.g., YouTube, Twitter/X) was considered the canonical source. To identify duplicates and near-duplicates across these platforms, a combination of methods was used, including fuzzy title matching (using Levenshtein distance) and content-based hashing (using algorithms like SimHash) to detect similarities even with minor edits.",
      "compliance_summary": "All data collection activities were governed by a strict compliance framework to adhere to legal, ethical, and platform-specific policies. The primary approach was to use official APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API, Twitter API) whenever available, respecting all documented rate limits, developer agreements, and usage policies. For platforms without suitable APIs or for general web crawling, the `robots.txt` file of each domain was strictly respected to honor the site owner's instructions for automated access. This included adhering to `Disallow` directives and `Crawl-delay` requests. All collected content is acknowledged as being protected by copyright, and the creation of derivative works like summaries and transcripts was undertaken with consideration for the 'fair use' doctrine. For third-party content, such as podcast interviews, it was recognized that obtaining explicit consent from the copyright holder (the podcast creator) is a legal and ethical requirement before creating and distributing transcripts."
    },
    "known_gaps_and_limitations": {
      "deleted_content": "A significant gap in the dataset is content that Shreyas Doshi may have deleted from its original platform. While efforts were made to recover such content using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, not all deleted items are archived. Deletions can be inferred from platform responses, such as an HTTP `404 Not Found` or `410 Gone` status for web pages, or specific API error codes like `144` ('No status found with that ID') from the Twitter/X API. The dataset may therefore be missing tweets, posts, or articles that were published and subsequently removed before they could be collected or archived.",
      "private_content": "The collection is limited to publicly accessible content. Any notes or materials shared behind paywalls, logins, or with restricted privacy settings are not included. This includes content on his paid Maven courses ('Improving Your Product Sense' and 'Managing your PM Career'), which is explicitly marketed as exclusive. Similarly, his newsletters on Substack and his personal website do not have public archives, so their content is only available to direct subscribers. Posts on platforms like LinkedIn shared with a 'connections-only' visibility or tweets from a protected account (inferred from an HTTP `403 Forbidden` status or Twitter API error `179`) would also be excluded from this public collection.",
      "technical_limitations": "The data collection process was subject to several technical limitations. Official platform APIs, while the preferred method, impose strict rate limits (e.g., the free X API v2 tier is highly restrictive) that can constrain the volume of data collected in a given timeframe. Furthermore, web crawlers are bound by `robots.txt` directives, which often prohibit access to large sections of a site, and they cannot access the 'deep web'—content behind login forms or search boxes. The dynamic, JavaScript-heavy nature of modern social media feeds also presents challenges for standard crawlers. These technical barriers mean that some public content may have been missed.",
      "completeness_estimate": "It is not possible to claim 100% completeness for this dataset. The collection represents a comprehensive but ultimately incomplete snapshot of Shreyas Doshi's entire body of work. The dynamic nature of the web, the existence of deleted and private content, and the technical limitations of data collection mean that some materials will inevitably be missing. The dataset should be considered a best-effort compilation based on publicly available information at the time of collection. Statistical methods like capture-recapture could be used to estimate the size of the unobserved content, but the final dataset remains an estimate rather than a complete census."

This aligns with the finegrained field's channel_url, subscriber_count, and video_count, and corroborates the profile's identity as the Shreyas Doshi channel. Supporting excerpts likewise reference the YouTube Channel Page context for Shreyas Doshi, reinforcing that the source is indeed the official or primary channel page and not a secondary aggregation or unrelated page. These excerpts collectively substantiate the channel's identity, its subscriber base, and its volume of content, which are core pieces of the requested data. The surrounding details (e.g., advisor roles and affiliation in the same excerpt) help confirm the content focus as product management, leadership, and related themes, which matches the focus described in the field value. Together, they validate not only the existence of the channel but also its typical content scope (product management, leadership, AI implications in PM). The ordering reflects the direct match to the field value: the first excerpt provides the exact numeric channel stats and identity, while the subsequent channel-page excerpts corroborate the channel's existence and focus.",

      "reasoning": "The most relevant excerpts directly identify podcast appearances and episode context for Shreyas Doshi. For example, excerpts presenting the Knowledge Project episode 175 with the title Shreyas Doshi: Better Teams, Better Products clearly map to a specific show and episode, illustrating a platform (The Knowledge Project) and a concrete episode number, which directly fulfills the platform_overview_podcasts field's intent to catalog appearances on major podcasts. Extended lines from adjacent passages confirm the same show and expand on the episode's framing (Better Teams, Better Products), reinforcing the linkage between the person and the podcast platform. Additional excerpts enumerate multiple appearances on the Knowledge Project and catalog other shows like Lenny's Podcast and The Skip Podcast, which aligns with the field's need to summarize a set of appearances across distinct platforms. The presence of passages that mention Lenny's Podcast and its episodes (Product | Career | Growth) and explicit references to pre-mortems, the LNO framework, and other signature frameworks during those conversations provide a consistent, thematically unified view across platforms, supporting the field's topics (the core frameworks and career advice discussed in these conversations). Further supporting evidence comes from excerpts listing The Skip Podcast appearances, including episode references and date markers, which strengthens the \"platform_overview_podcasts\" field by expanding the list of platforms and tying in additional content themes like time management, high agency, and product strategy discussions that recur across Shreyas's podcast appearances. The excerpts citing Lenny's Podcast, Infinite Loops, and CPO Mastery (and related transcript or summary references) further corroborate the breadth of appearances and the recurring themes (LNO framework, High Agency, three levels of product work, ROI vs opportunity cost thinking, pre-mortems) that underpin the field value. Together, these excerpts provide direct mappings from Shreyas's podcast appearances to the named shows and capture the consistent themes he discusses in those conversations. Overall, the collection of excerpts supports a high-confidence interpretation that Shreyas Doshi's platform_overview_podcasts includes multiple prominent podcasts (The Knowledge Project, Lenny's Podcast, The Skip Podcast, Infinite Loops, CPO Mastery) and highlights his signature frameworks and interview themes across these appearances.",

For example, excerpts that state there is an official site and profiles (such as the official site hub and lists of profiles) provide the core canonical sources used to anchor claims about identity. They serve as the primary signals for disambiguating among similarly named individuals by pointing to primary, verifiable sources authored or managed by Shreyas Doshi himself. Other excerpts explicitly reference specific profile hubs across platforms (e.g., X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube) that function as cross-platform identity signals, reinforcing the multi-source verification approach. Additional excerpts that enumerate or point to multiple canonical channels (e.g., official site pages and multi-profile listings) further support the described strategy of cross-referencing canonical sources to confirm authorship. The presence of multiple, platform-specific entries tied to a central person (Shreyas Doshi) provides the necessary anchors for identity disambiguation and reinforces that canonical, official sources are the backbone of the verification strategy. Taken together, these excerpts directly inform the field's identity verification workflow by confirming: (1) existence of an official home page and profiles, (2) cross-platform profiles that can be used as corroborating signals, and (3) a practice of cross-referencing canonical sources to disambiguate identity across similarly named individuals.",

Excerpts that explicitly name SlideShare-presented decks provide direct support for the existence and content of these decks. For example, a SlideShare entry titled Becoming an Effective Product Management Leader appears, indicating a deck that covers the progression from individual contributor to leader, including strategy, prioritization, and coaching and references to the 10-30-50 PM framework. Other excerpts reference a SlideShare listing for My Journey and Product Management Lessons Learned, a 49-slide deck reflecting on a 15-year career and key lessons such as high agency. An excerpt about How To Get That Next PM Job also appears as a SlideShare deck from 2010, providing tactical guidance for job seekers. The given field value also mentions an older deck on \"How To Get That Next PM Job,\" consistent with the SlideShare entries in the excerpts. Collectively, these excerpts corroborate that Shreyas has published multiple SlideShare slide decks with structured content on PM leadership, career progression, and practical job-search guidance. The reasoning connecting each deck to the field value is based on direct alignment: the excerpts reference SlideShare presentations and match the described deck topics (leadership, career lessons, and job-hunting strategies) as summarized in the field value. The 121-slide deck framing (Becoming an Effective PM Leader) aligns with the summary of transitioning to leadership and includes components like strategy, prioritization, and coaching. The 49-slide deck (My Journey and Product Management Lessons Learned) aligns with a long-form reflection on 15 years in PM and the emphasis on \"high agency.\" The older deck (How To Get That Next PM Job) aligns with tactical, career-oriented guidance for PMs transitioning roles. The extra Deck entries listed in the excerpts reinforce that SlideShare is a primary platform for these detailed, structured presentations, as described in the field value.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "The core fine-grained field lists several intertwined frameworks and concepts, each with a definitional core and recognizable origin. The most directly relevant excerpts provide canonical descriptions or explicit framing of these items. For the LNO Framework, the excerpt titled LNO Framework - Shreyas Doshi lays out the three-part classification (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead) and the motivation to allocate energy toward high-impact work, reduce perfectionism on low-impact tasks, and focus on high-leverage activities. This aligns with the field's description of LNO as a three-category prioritization schema and its aim to maximize long-term impact. A closely related excerpt explicitly titled The LNO Framework Explained by Shreyas Doshi further clarifies the origin, purpose, and application of the framework, reinforcing the core components and how they drive prioritization decisions. Additional excerpts formalize and expand the LNO concept, including explanations that Leverage tasks yield large returns, Neutral tasks yield modest returns, and Overhead tasks are necessary but low-impact, providing a concrete justification for the framework's guidance to reallocate effort toward high-leverage work.\n\nBeyond LNO, the field includes High Agency as a pivotal trait. Excerpts describing High Agency trace the term to a well-known Twitter thread and subsequent LinkedIn and other writings, framing it as an initiative-taking, problem-solving stance that correlates with leadership effectiveness in product roles. This matches the field's framing of High Agency as a core personal attribute to be cultivated and into which practitioners should invest effort.\n\nThe Preventable Problem Paradox is captured in excerpts that discuss the paradox's origin in organizational behavior and its articulation in Shreyas Doshi's Medium and LinkedIn writings. The field value presents this paradox as a central concept explaining why leaders prevent problems poorly—captured by the referenced analysis and cross-posted derivations.\n\nThe 7 Biases of Product Teams are described in excerpts that enumerate the biases, their effect on decision-making, and the need for shared vocabulary and countermeasures. This aligns with the field's item on a framework of cognitive biases that affect product teams.\n\nAgency-Talent Matrix and Good vs Great Product Managers are represented in excerpts that describe evaluating people by both their agency (proactivity) and talent (ability), and how Great PMs differ from Good PMs in terms of depth, strategy, and impact. These excerpts map to the field's items about comparing and contrasting PM performance and the role of agency in leadership/management.\n\nAdditionally, several excerpts provide cross-linkages and origins (podcasts, LinkedIn posts, and blogs) that corroborate the lineage and dissemination of these frameworks, serving as contextual support for the field value's origin_source_summary.\n\nOverall, the most directly relevant excerpts provide definitional content for the LNO framework, High Agency, The Preventable Problem Paradox, The 7 Biases of Product Teams, Agency-Talent Matrix, and Good vs Great Product Managers, and they collectively support the fine-grained field value. The other excerpts that reference these concepts in a broader or derivative context (cross-posts, podcasts, lectures) provide corroboration but are secondary to the core definitional items.\n",

      "reasoning": "- Deleted_content: The dataset contains explicit signs of content that no longer exists or is unavailable. For example, a fetched web page shows a 404 Not Found for a Shreyas Doshi YouTube page, indicating deletion or removal from the original hosting platform. This is a direct demonstration of deleted material contributing to gaps in the collection. A related instance on a page titled as a 404 page for Good Product Managers, Great Product Managers confirms that certain items are not retrievable, reinforcing the deleted_content aspect of the gaps. These lines illustrate the dataset's gaps where content once existed but is no longer accessible. \n- Private_content: Several excerpts describe content that is publicly inaccessible or gated behind private access or subscription models, implying gaps in public availability. While not every private resource is shown, the surrounding discussion and the presence of paywalled or subscriber-only content (e.g., newsletters on Substack or paid Maven courses) provide evidence that the dataset cannot capture these elements publicly, contributing to the completeness gap. The explicit mention that private content exists and is excluded supports the private_content portion of known gaps. \n- Technical_limitations and access restrictions: The collection is constrained by access controls and platform policies. References to robots.txt blocks and crawling restrictions show that automated harvesting may be blocked on some sites, creating gaps in data capture. Examples include robots.txt excerpts and policy notes indicating crawl bans or restrictions on automated access. Additionally, policy changes by platforms (such as X banning crawling/scraping) illustrate how external rules constrain data collection. This supports the technical_limitations component. \n- Wayback/archive limitations and data retrieval: The Wayback/archival layer introduces its own limitations. There are notes about JSON output for CDX API, which affects how structured archival data can be retrieved; explicit statements about available output formats (JSON) and usage constraints signal data access boundaries. This aligns with the completeness_estimate and technical limitations components by highlighting how archiving interfaces influence what can be recovered. \n- Completeness_estimate: The combination of deleted_content, private_content, and technical_limitations logically leads to an estimate of incompleteness. The excerpts collectively illustrate that not all of Shreyas Doshi's output is publicly accessible, some is removed or gated, and access is constrained by platform policies and archival limitations, which justifies an explicit completeness_estimate in the field.",

These excerpts confirm that the personal site exists as a portal with sections and that some live links lead to 404s, which aligns with the claim that the homepage serves as a directory pointing to canonical versions hosted elsewhere and that the sitemap reveals placeholders. Additional excerpts describe the site as the Official Site and Profiles, listing sections such as Advising, Courses, Speaking, and Writing, which corroborates the claim that shreyasdoshi.com is intended as a central hub for his work with these distinct sections. Other excerpts mention the Writing section as an index to his articles and provide context that the site began with content such as writing about products, leadership, and management, which supports the idea of the Writing index being a key feature of the site. The sitemap-related excerpts further substantiate the notion of placeholders and missing live content, reinforcing the interpretation that missing items on the site point to canonical versions hosted on other platforms. In combination, these excerpts support the description of the site as a central portal with navigational sections, a Writing index, and a sitemap that includes placeholders/404s, and they illustrate the on-site live feeds and cross-platform content strategy inferred in the field value.",

The third excerpt references the same YouTube channel page and again includes the 26.7K subscriber figure, further corroborating the value.

Among the excerpts, the ones mentioning playlists indicate that the channel uses playlists as curated groups (e.g., the mention of playlists on the channel page). These excerpts show that playlists exist on the channel, which supports the idea of organized, thematic collections. However, none of the excerpts directly describe the learning-path structure, explicit organization by topic, or the specific playlist names and video counts listed in the field value. Therefore, these excerpts provide partial support: they confirm that playlists are present, but they do not substantiate the detailed learning-path curriculum and exact playlist counts described. The other excerpts reference the channel in terms of subscribers, general page content, or navigation, but do not speak to organized playlists or learning paths, so they contribute little to the claimed structured curriculum.\n",

Another excerpt mentions '258 videos' in the context of the channel's content catalog, which corroborates the numerical figure for video_count. A third excerpt similarly references the same numeric total within the channel overview, reinforcing the same value. Together, these excerpts provide direct, consistent evidence for a video_count of 258 (258.0 when represented as a float).

      "reasoning": "The field summary describes a comprehensive, cross-platform collection of Shreyas Doshi's notes and content across multiple hubs. Explicit references to a central site and profile pages establish the hub-and-spoke model the summary requires. The site and profiles excerpts articulate that Shreyas Doshi maintains an official site with linked sections for Advising, Courses, Speaking, Writing, and a Contact page, which anchors the corpus. The social profiles and posts excerpts confirm the dispersion of notes and content across major platforms: Twitter/X threads and highlights, LinkedIn Pulse posts, and Medium writings, all of which serve as repositories of his ideas and learnings. The YouTube excerpts show a primary channel and its content, including Shorts, indicating a large, ongoing video-based collection that complements long-form writing. The Thread Reader App and Thread/Linked content excerpts illustrate large-thread and curated-note practices that extend the corpus to social-line content formats. The inclusion of Slides on SlideShare and references to Maven-hosted courses further demonstrate the multi-platform nature of the collection. Together, these excerpts substantiate the claim that the collection_summary exists as a cross-platform archive: a central hub (shreyasdoshi.com) plus major platforms (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium, YouTube), plus podcasts and slides, all contributing to a learner-focused library. The strongest support comes from excerpts that enumerate the official site and its sections, plus direct mentions of social profiles and video channels, which collectively map to the collection_summary described in the field value.",

      "reasoning": "The field value describes Shreyas Doshi's Twitter/X as a central hub for his notes, including multi-tweet threads, with emphasis on unrolled Thread Reader App versions and a subscriber-only content index. The most directly relevant excerpts explicitly discuss a thread-based content strategy on X, including references to a thread of product management frameworks and an unrolled, readable thread version via Thread Reader App. Specifically, the excerpts describing a dedicated thread of product management frameworks on X map to the concept of a long-form, threaded note distribution that underpins his public notes. Related excerpts explicitly mentioning the Thread Reader App as a platform for unrolling threads further corroborate that his notes are distributed and consumed in a thread-based, iterative format. Additional excerpts cite a specific post that aggregates or highlights his most popular threads, which aligns with the idea of a curated, high-signal collection of notes shared on Twitter/X. Finally, multiple excerpts confirm the existence of Shreyas Doshi's Twitter/X profile and the content he posts there, reinforcing that Twitter/X functions as the primary distribution channel for his notes. Quoted material from these excerpts includes statements about a thread on X with a sequence of ideas, the unrolled form via Thread Reader App, and the notion of popular threads being published and shared on X. Collectively, these excerpts substantiate the field value's claim about the centrality and nature of Shreyas Doshi's notes distribution on Twitter/X, the role of Thread Reader App in rendering those notes accessible, and the existence of a separate subscriber-indexed content repository referenced in public material.",

Additional excerpts describe his broader podcast-related content, interviews, and discussions (e.g., Lenny's Podcast and related transcripts or show notes), reinforcing the notion that his appearances span multiple high-profile podcasts and related media formats. Other excerpts that profile his career and voice in product leadership further support the context that he is a frequent guest in long-form discussions where he elaborates on product frameworks and career learnings, often drawing on his experience at major tech companies. Collectively, these excerpts map a consistent picture of a high-visibility podcast guest with a track record across several well-known shows and formats, including The Knowledge Project, Lenny's Podcast, Spotify-hosted episodes, and Founder Mode features, which aligns with the requested summary of appearances on industry-leading podcasts.",

Excerpts that describe the official site and its role as a central hub (and that mention cross-links to other profiles and general biography) directly support the notion of a primary canonical source for attribution. Excerpts that summarize the person's professional focus and roles (product leadership, advising, coaching) and mention past employers or social handles provide corroborating signals that help distinguish this individual from similarly named individuals. Excerpts that enumerate or link to specific social profiles (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, YouTube) offer concrete identity handles that can be used to verify authorship across platforms. While some excerpts emphasize activities (writing, courses, speaking) rather than identity verification, they still contribute contextual backing to the overall identity profile by reinforcing the public persona that these canonical links and bios describe. None of the excerpts explicitly describe the exact verification workflow, but together they form a coherent dataset of canonical identity signals (official site, linked profiles, and biographical identifiers) that underpin the disambiguation process described in the finegrained field value.",

Additional corroborating details explain how Leverage tasks yield a 10x-100x return, which reinforces the terminology and the intended impact. Other excerpts extend the discussion by explaining the framework's origins and its use in various contexts (e.g., explanations in blogs or talks), which supports the field value's origin_source_summary, though these are slightly more contextual than definitional.

It also mentions methods for duplicate detection such as Levenshtein distance and content-based hashing. Among the provided excerpts, several consistently identify the official site and profiles as sources of information (e.g., the personal site and its sections, and social profiles). These excerpts establish where content originates and can serve as potential canonical sources or data points for evaluating authority and duplication across platforms. They state the existence of official channels and content types (writing, courses, advising, speaking), which could be mapped to the described data collection domains. Other excerpts reinforce the breadth of presence (social profiles, description of professional roles), which helps in identifying candidate canonical sources across platforms. However, none of the excerpts explicitly state the canonicalization rules themselves (e.g., the existence of a rel=\"canonical\" tag, earliest date rule, or hashing methods). Therefore, while they do not confirm the policy, they provide contextual anchors about where authoritative information may reside, which is relevant to constructing or validating a canonical record. The strongest alignment is with excerpts that clearly identify primary sources (the official site and its sections) and explicit platform-based content origins, as these are central to determining canonical sources in practice. The remaining excerpts provide useful context about the person's online presence but do not directly address the canonicalization criteria.",

Excerpts that explicitly mention positions and timeframes (for example, leading Stripe products with a position at Stripe, and dates for Twitter, Google, and Yahoo) directly substantiate the requested professional history. The assertive statements that he led Stripe's successful products and his prior roles at Twitter, Google, and Yahoo provide concrete anchors for the timeline and roles. Other excerpts from the official site describe services and areas of advising or speaking, which are informative for his overall profile but do not supply the explicit chronological job-title-and-dates details required by the field value. By prioritizing excerpts that contain the explicit job titles, organizations, and dates, and then including those with complementary but less-detailed biography information, we construct a coherent mapping to the requested field value. The most relevant parts mention specific companies and exact or range-based dates in his product-management career, directly aligning with the field value's content needs. The less specific site-listing excerpts still corroborate his professional identity and areas of expertise, but do not contradict the dates or roles identified in the more relevant excerpts.",

This excerpt directly supports both the existence of High Agency as a defined concept and the guidance to consult the original post, thereby substantiating the origin aspect in the field value. Another excerpt contributes supporting context by describing the broader concept of agency, noting that the matrix contrasts levels of agency with talent and clarifying that agency relates to initiative and capability, which helps situate High Agency within a wider framing of agency concepts, even though it does not explicitly name High Agency.

Excerpts that describe terms banning crawling and scraping highlight external constraints on data collection, which support the idea that complete coverage is not guaranteed. Excerpts describing the Wayback CDX Server API and related help pages illustrate that captured data is produced via APIs with capabilities for querying snapshots and availability, which inherently yields a partial, time-bound view of content rather than a guaranteed exhaustive corpus. The example JSON showing how archived snapshots are reported reinforces that data availability is contingent on what was captured and indexed at specific times, not on a universal, complete record. Additional notes about alignment with downloadable APIs and standards (e.g., Memento) further reinforce that the data landscape is composite and incomplete by design. Taken together, these excerpts corroborate the claim that the dataset is best-effort and not complete, due to web dynamics, content deletion/private status, and technical/crawling limitations.",

The most directly supportive content explicitly states the meaning of the acronym within the framework: it describes that the \"LNO\" stands for Leverage, Neutral, and Overhead, which aligns with the requested full name including the expanded components. Other excerpts consistently reference the framework by its name or as \"LNO Framework\" and discuss its purpose (prioritizing tasks, focusing on leverage activities, improving productivity), which corroborates the existence and branding of the framework but does not contradict the exact expanded form. The remaining excerpts further illustrate usage and impact of the LNO framework, reinforcing that this is a known named framework and that it is centered on prioritization and efficiency, all of which support the relevance of the field value even if they do not spell out the full expansion themselves. Taken together, these excerpts collectively substantiate both the existence of the LNO Framework and its expansion as Leverage, Neutral, and Overhead, with the strongest evidence coming from the explicit statement of what LNO stands for, followed by corroborating mentions of the framework's name and its practical emphasis.",

By aligning the field_value items with excerpts that precisely reflect those items' content, we establish direct support for the field value. The ordering from most to least relevant follows where a direct match to a specific work is found (title and topic aligned closely with the field value) before excerpts that are thematically related but more secondary (e.g., general PM leadership discussions, or later commentary). This approach ensures a tight coupling between each field item and its strongest supporting source within the excerpts.",

Excerpts that explicitly name the three categories and define their returns directly support this description.

Additional excerpts reinforce the prioritization of leverage activities to get more done and improve productivity, which corroborates the framework's goal of maximizing long-term impact. Various excerpts collectively outline the mechanism (classifying work, focusing on leverage, reducing time spent on low-impact tasks) and the motivation (maximize long-term impact, clear focus on high-leverage activities).

This supports the idea that not all customer feedback leads to adoption and that a critical evaluation step is needed before committing resources. Other excerpts discuss general product-management storytelling, improving sales tactics, or early-detectable lifecycle insights; these provide contextual background about how product decisions are made but do not directly substantiate the specific cautionary claim or the CPSR framework. Together, the collection reinforces a cautious stance toward translating feedback into development priorities, which is consistent with the finegrained field value's emphasis on validating true customer problems before resource commitment. Direct references to the CPSR framework or the exact described cognitive bias are not present in the excerpts, so the support is indirect but thematically aligned.",

The excerpts consistently refer to a work titled 'A B2B Product Management Story' with a linked source on LinkedIn Pulse, which is a platform known for article-style posts rather than short social updates or media like videos. The presence of a formal title, a specific source URL, and notes about publication (e.g., 'Published Jun 1, 2020') aligns with an article's metadata rather than other content types. Several excerpts explicitly reinforce the article-like nature by framing the content as a narrative or story about product management and by referencing publication details. Thus, these excerpts collectively support the classification of the content item as an Article. The entries that simply list the author name or provide repetitive phrasing reinforce the article-context without introducing conflicting indicators about a non-article format. Taken together, the strongest, most direct indicators are the explicit title, the LinkedIn Pulse source, and publication dating, which together map to an Article classification. The other excerpts provide corroborating context (topic, author, and content focus) that reinforces the article-type conclusion, though they are slightly less explicit about the format itself.",

Additionally, notes about post-mortems and After Action Reviews being part of standard organizational processes after outages or project executions further align with project governance and continuous improvement typical of project management. The mention of performing a premortem in a credible source (Harvard Business Review) reinforces the connection to established project-management methodology.

Excerpt 0 directly references the article's topic in the title, clearly aligning with the notion of using pre-mortems to prevent problems and disasters. Excerpt 4 discusses discussing combating the preventable problem paradox and, importantly, notes using pre-mortems to create a culture of problem prevention within the organization, which supports the idea of applying pre-mortems in practice. Excerpt 6 explicitly cites the source as a premortem-related article, anchoring the concept in a practical framework. Excerpt 5 notes that post-mortems and related reviews are part of standard processes in many organizations, providing contextual support that pre-mortems fit into a broader, actionable performance-improvement workflow. Excerpt 3 provides a dated reference to the article, reinforcing that this is a published practical discussion. Excerpts 1 and 2 replicate the article's context (title and read time), which further corroborates the practical topic but are less about the step-by-step application than about identification of the source. Excerpt 2's \"7 min read\" and Excerpt 1's author mention help confirm the article's existence and relevance to the topic but contribute less directly to the procedural guidance described in the field value.",

Excerpt with a direct note about \"30/ Good PMs attain conventional career success… Great PMs also attain a higher form of success\" aligns with the idea of extensive, multi-dimensional evaluation (the 30 dimensions) and the distinction between good and great in terms of impact and depth. Excerpts that compare Good vs Great PMs and discuss outcomes or trajectories provide direct support for the core contrast and the idea that Great PMs improve the company trajectory through their work, which echoes the idea of prioritizing long-term impact and deeper influence. Additional excerpts that reiterate the contrast between Good and Great PMs and describe how Great PMs drive better results or trajectory further substantiate the framework of evaluating PMs across multiple dimensions and through strategic lens.

Therefore, the strongest support comes from the excerpts that reference Medium directly, with subsequent excerpts that provide peripheral context (date, title, or related notes) offering partial, indirect relevance.

Excerpts directly discuss the LNO Framework and Shreyas's perspective on task prioritization and productivity, which are core to his product-management frameworks and tactical approaches. Specifically: the first excerpt identifies the LNO Framework and frames it as a method for prioritizing tasks to increase effectiveness, aligning with the notion of a framework-based approach to product work. The second excerpt frames the LNO Framework as a tool to fight procrastination and improve productivity, reinforcing the idea of practical, workflow-oriented insights. The third excerpt explicitly mentions that the LNO Framework classifies tasks into three types, which resonates with the notion of structured, multi-type task handling within product work. Other excerpts mention Shreyas's YouTube presence and other talks, which provide broader context about his frameworks and philosophy, further supporting the overall topic of Shreyas's frameworks and product-management insights, even though they don't directly quote the Lenny's Podcast content. Taken together, these excerpts corroborate the general theme of Shreyas sharing actionable frameworks and productivity-oriented approaches in public content, which is relevant to the described deep-dive interview field value, even if they do not confirm the exact podcast details.",

Excerpts that present the foundational ideas and core articles on Good Product Strategy and related \"foundational\" topics (such as Good Product Managers, Great Product Managers, and The Preventable Problem Paradox, plus pre-mortems) provide a solid anchor for Module 1. Writings on consolidating material (LinkedIn/Medium posts) and presentations (SlideShare) help structure Module 3 content, offering advanced perspectives and real-world applications. References to media appearances (Lenny's Podcast, The Knowledge Project) and the YouTube channel offer practical,![and updated] pathways for Module 3, where learners move from written content to audio/video deep-dives and current thinking. The inclusion of specific posts and multimedia sources (Good Product Strategy, Bad Product Strategy; The Preventable Problem Paradox; How to Use Pre-mortems; LNO Framework docs; YouTube playlists; Lenny's/Knowledge Project episodes) supports constructing a progressive curriculum: start with foundational strategy and core principles, then master the LNO and other pragmatic frameworks, and finally explore advanced career tactics, AI-adjacent content, and ongoing thought leadership through podcasts and videos. The closest, most direct supports come from explicit LNO framework documentation and description of its use, followed by explicit statements of foundational posts and core frameworks. The remaining excerpts supplement with concrete examples, commentary, or media where learners can deepen understanding and see real-world implementations of these ideas.",

            "Z-score Normalization. Z-score normalization, or standardization, transforms a dataset to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This technique enables comparisons between datasets with different scales, effectively allowing features measured in different units or ranges to be analyzed on equal footing. The formula for Z-score normalization is as follows",
            "Robust Scaling is a normalization technique designed to handle datasets with outliers effectively. Unlike other methods (e.g., Z-score normalization), it scales the data by removing the median and dividing by the interquartile range (IQR), making it less sensitive to extreme values. This approach ensures that the scaled data is centered around zero and lies within a consistent range.",
            "\n\nIn this normalization process:",
            "rocess:\n\n* X is the original value. * Z is the normalized value. * μ is the mean of the series. * σ is the standard deviation of the series. This method assumes the data follows a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. The resulting curve is symmetric and bell-shaped, centered at the mean (μ=0), with probabilities decreasing as values move farther from the mean. This shape reflects the standard normal distribution, where most data points cluster around the mean, and extreme values are less frequent. Press enter or click to view image in full size",
            "To check if a dataset follows a Gaussian distribution, you can use visual methods and statistical tests. ## Visual Methods",
            "Common visual methods include:",
            "* **Histogram** : Plot a histogram of the data and overlay a Gaussian curve. Observe if the shape of the histogram closely resembles a bell curve. Press enter or click to view image in full size",
            "* **Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)** : This plots the quantiles of your dataset (blue dots) against the quantiles of a theoretical Gaussian distribution (red line). If the points fall along a straight diagonal line, the data likely follows a Gaussian distribution.",
            "Commonly applied in finance, biology, and when analyzing data with heavy tails, it ensures that extreme values do not dominate the analysis. Here:",
            "* X represents the original value. * log is the logarithm function, typically the natural log or log base 10. * c is a constant added to handle zero or negative values (e.g., c = 1 when the data includes zero values). Key considerations and limitations:",
            "1. Logarithms are undefined for zero and negative values, so a constant (c) must be added to the dataset. This adjustment can affect the interpretability of results. 2. The transformed data no longer corresponds to the original scale, making it less intuitive. 3. The choice of logarithmic base (e.g., natural log vs. log base 10) may influence the outcome and needs careful consideration. 4. Applying a log transformation to already symmetric data can distort its shape, potentially reducing model performance. # Robust Scaling Normalization",

            "Works well when outliers are present, as it emphasizes the central part of the data. It is commonly used in scenarios such as income distributions or stock price analysis, where extreme values are frequent. Here:",
            "* X is the original value;\n* median(X) is the median of the dataset;\n* IQR(X) is the interquartile range (Q3−Q1), where Q3 is the 75th percentile and Q1 is the 25th percentile. Limitations and considerations:",
            "1. Since it relies on the median and IQR, this scaling process may lose valuable information about the tails of the distribution. 2. For symmetric and well-behaved data without outliers, alternative methods like Z-score normalization might be more suitable. 3. It may perform poorly with sparse datasets where the IQR is zero or close to zero for certain features. # Other Materials",

            "Deconstruct your Taxonomy** – One of the keys to today’s taxonomy design efforts, and one of the major changes from the past, is that the concepts of faceting, along with advances in taxonomy management and information management technologies have given us the ability to step away from the “one taxonomy to rule them all” model. As opposed to a terribly deep and detailed taxonomy with a mix of different terms, today we strive for clean and simple taxonomies, each of which may power a separate metadata field in a one taxonomy for one metadata field type of model. This easily enables the concepts of faceted navigation and search now available out-of-the-box in most information management systems. It also improves the accuracy of auto-categorization tools and creates the potential for much easier taxonomy and content governance by ensuring mandatory fields are completed correctl",

      "reasoning": "The finegrained field value centers on LinkedIn as Shreyas Doshi's canonical platform for long-form writing (LinkedIn Pulse) and a hub for his posts, with explicit references to his LinkedIn profile and LinkedIn content as a primary source of his published material. The most directly supportive excerpts are those that explicitly name LinkedIn as the source or hub and provide a LinkedIn URL. For example, one excerpt clearly identifies the LinkedIn profile URL (linkedin.com/in/shreyasrdoshi) and describes it as the hub where he is a principal source for content such as long-form articles and posts. Other excerpts mention Shreyas Doshi's LinkedIn posts and articles on LinkedIn, including posts and collections that are hosted on LinkedIn. Additional excerpts show a pattern of LinkedIn-origin content (e.g., \"LinkedIn Post\" entries or \"LinkedIn Pulse\" references) that reinforce LinkedIn as the canonical platform for his writings and public content, alongside other platforms like Medium or X, but the LinkedIn-centric items are the strongest direct evidence of LinkedIn serving as the central hub and canonical source for much of his writing. Therefore, excerpts that explicitly reference his LinkedIn profile or LinkedIn-based posts are the most relevant to the field value, followed by excerpts that indicate LinkedIn hosts notable posts or articles attributed to him. Confidence in the field value is medium-to-high given the strong explicit LinkedIn references, with higher confidence for items that directly cite the LinkedIn URL or LinkedIn-hosted content and lower confidence for items that mention LinkedIn in passing without tying it to canonical content. The excerpts are ordered from most relevant to least based on the directness of LinkedIn as a canonical hub and source for Shreyas Doshi's content: excerpt mentioning the LinkedIn profile URL; excerpts noting LinkedIn posts or Pulse content; excerpts mentioning LinkedIn posts in general; and finally broader mentions within cross-platform contexts.",
