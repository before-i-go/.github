#### Use Case 4: Form Validation Schema Generator
- **PMF Probability**: High (8/10) - Forms are ubiquitous and validation is always needed
- **Ease of Testing**: High (9/10) - Clear input/output validation
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that generates Zod schemas from TypeScript interfaces or JSON schemas, with optimizations for React Hook Form integration, including proper error message mapping and field-level validation rules.
- **Parallels**: Similar to json-schema-to-typescript but for validation schemas, like Prisma's schema generation

#### Use Case 5: Component Composition Analyzer
- **PMF Probability**: Medium-High (7/10) - Composition patterns are crucial for maintainable React
- **Ease of Testing**: High (8/10) - Static analysis with clear metrics
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that analyzes React component hierarchies to detect anti-patterns like god components, suggest compound component patterns, and identify opportunities for better composition using children props and render props.

#### Use Case 6: Server/Client State Boundary Detector
- **PMF Probability**: High (8/10) - Modern React apps struggle with this distinction
- **Ease of Testing**: Medium-High (7/10) - Requires understanding of data flow
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that analyzes React codebases to identify server state vs client state usage patterns, detect when server state is incorrectly stored in client state managers, and suggest proper data fetching patterns.
- **Parallels**: Like data flow analysis tools, similar to how Redux DevTools tracks state but for architectural patterns
