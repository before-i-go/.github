#### Use Case 36: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Generator
- **PMF Probability**: High (8/10) - Hardware abstraction is fundamental to portable systems
- **Ease of Testing**: High (8/10) - Clear interface generation and validation
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that generates portable Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interfaces from device specifications, supporting multiple bus types (PCIe, USB, I2C) and providing unified APIs for cross-platform driver development.
- **Parallels**: Similar to embedded-hal but more comprehensive, like CMSIS but cross-platform and generated

#### Use Case 37: VirtIO Compatibility Framework
- **PMF Probability**: Medium-High (7/10) - Virtualization is important for modern systems
- **Ease of Testing**: High (8/10) - Clear virtualization interface testing
- **5-liner**: A Rust library that provides a comprehensive VirtIO implementation framework, enabling easy creation of VirtIO devices and drivers, with support for paravirtualization and hardware passthrough optimization.
- **Parallels**: Similar to QEMU's VirtIO implementation but as a reusable library, like hypervisor frameworks but focused on device abstraction
